# tejastango

This is frozen snapshot of Tejastango.com from July 2015.

For 20 years this website has great written documentation for DJs, music and video collectors, and beginning dancers.

With Stephen Brown closing down his domain in Sept 2015, it became necessary to quickly find a place to archive the important
information.

We hope the transition will preserves transparently most of the links between tango web pages.

to do:
- remove obsolete email
- add analytics
- create separate tango documentation from each of tejastango's sections
