<h2>
<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
The number DVDs, video downloads and video tapes offering instruction in
Argentine tango continues to grow.&nbsp; As recently as the mid-1990s, about
20 instructional video tapes were available in North America.&nbsp; Some
were of dubious quality.&nbsp; Today, about 200 instructional DVDs, videos
downloads and video tapes are readily available.&nbsp; Many are excellent or
outstanding.
<p>The market has made a decided shift toward DVDs and video downloads.&nbsp; A
number of the titles that were once available on video are now only available
on DVD.&nbsp; A growing number of titles are available on video download.
<p>The large number of DVDs, video downloads and video tapes suggests that many
people find such instruction helpful in learning Argentine tango.&nbsp; If you
are fortunate enough to live in an active tango community with regular
instruction, videos can offer a different perspective and new ideas.&nbsp; If
you live in an area that is without regular instruction, videos may be the only
way to learn Argentine Tango.
<p>For a number of years, I have been watching, reviewing and rating videos
that offer instruction in Argentine tango.&nbsp; I started these reviews
by getting my hands on the 22 videos that I knew existed at the time—buying
some and borrowing others.&nbsp; In my naivete and inexperience in dancing
tango, I found it relatively easy to rate the videos by a simple criterion;
could I learn something useful from them?
<p>As the number of videos grew and my experience with Argentine tango
expanded to include a number of years teaching, I moved on to other subjective
criteria such as the quality of the dancing (including the form and musicality
of the movement), the quality of the video production, the clarity of the
instruction, and the usefulness of the material for social dancing (or other
stated purpose).&nbsp; For videos intended for advanced dancers, I also look
for originality, which puts an ever increasing burden on the newer videos
offering advanced material.&nbsp; Always at the forefront of my mind is a
variation of my original question: Can the viewer learn something useful from
the video?
<p>People who know me, my dancing, my tango friends and my tango mentors
are likely to know the inherent biases that I have in rating instructional
videos even better than I do.&nbsp; I dance social Argentine tango improvisationally.&nbsp;
Moreover, I consider improvisation a basic skill rather than an advanced
skill.&nbsp; Only a few of the videos offer instruction that is designed
to develop improvisational skills.&nbsp; Most notable are those by <a href="#Cote_improvisation">Christy
Cot&eacute; and George Garcia</a>, <a href="bridge_tango.html#Naveira/Besio">Gustavo
Naveira and Olga Besio</a>, and <a href="#Trenner">Daniel Trenner</a>.&nbsp;
A few other videos offer instruction in <a href="#Structure">structure</a>
and <a href="#Technique">technique</a>.
<p>Nearly all of the available instructional DVDs, video downloads and video tapes
could convey the impression that Argentine tango is a collection of frozen step
patterns, including those videos that provide instruction in
<a href="#Milonguero">milonguero-style tango</a>.&nbsp; Although, I do not
consider learning rote patterns to be a foundation for dancing, learning such
patterns can provide knowledge that is useful for dancing.&nbsp; One can look at
the best of these videos as being of similar instructional value as a jazz musician
listening to and copying the solos of great jazz musicians.&nbsp; Consequently, I
accept these videos for what they are rather than what they are not.
<p>Although the <a href="#Zotto/Godoy">Osvaldo Zotto/Mora Godoy</a> videos
can convey the impression that Argentine tango is a collection of frozen
step patterns, they remain a standard by which to judge the quality of
other videos.&nbsp; I consider Osvaldo Zotto to be one of the great dancers
of his generation.&nbsp; In addition, the Zotto/Godoy five-video series
is a model of production values and clarity in instruction.
<p>To date, I have identified more than 200 instructional videos about
Argentine tango that are readily available for purchase in the United States.
(Although I make every attempt to keep abreast of the growing number of
instructional videos for Argentine Tango, there may be more.&nbsp; Please
excuse any omissions, and let me know if you discover any additional instructional
video downloads, video tapes or DVDs that are available.)&nbsp; For tango videos,
readily available is relative. It means someone will sell the tape to you via mail
order without having previously taught you the material.
<p><b><i>Caveat Emptor</i>:&nbsp; A number of videos once sold as Argentine
Tango offer instruction in ballroom Tango or a mixture of ballroom and
Argentine Tango.&nbsp; I include several such videos in the reviews, but
I make no attempt to provide comprehensive coverage of such videos.</b>

<h2>
<a NAME="DVD"></a>What's Available on DVD</h2>
Anyone who uses a DVD quickly recognizes the advantages of the medium for
instruction.&nbsp; If well indexed, an instructional DVD can provide the
viewer with rapid access to each segment that is of particular interest.&nbsp;
It is also an ideal medium for reviewing segments.&nbsp; Currently, the
number of instructional DVDs is limited to about 100 titles, but that number
has grown rapidly, and a number of titles that were once available only on video
are now only available on DVD.

<a NAME="bridge"></a>Bridge to the Tango Videos</h2>
Updated 1 September 2012
<p>Between 1996 and 2001, Daniel Trenner produced 72 instructional videos
for his Bridge to the Tango label.&nbsp; The videos cover his own teaching
and dancing, Rebecca Shulman's and that of a number of other masters from
the older and younger generations.

<p>An era came to an end on January 1, 2007 when all Bridge to the Tango
instructional videos were officially withdrawn from the market.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
several vendors have remaining copies of most of the Bridge to the Tango videos
for sale in VHS format.&nbsp; Among the sources are
<a href="http://www.danieltrenner.com/store_s" target="new">Daniel Trenner's store</a> and
Phil Seyer's <a href="http://www.Argentine-tango.com/" target="new">Argentine Tango webpage</a>.&nbsp;
In addition, Daniel Trenner is in the process of releasing the material as video downloads
available through <a href="http://www.itangocafe.com" target="new">itangocafe.com</a>.&nbsp;
In addition, Daniel has recorded several new videos which are only available as video downloads.

<p>Information about the complete Bridge to the Tango catalog is available through

<p><a NAME="Anton/Grodona"></a><b>Martha Anton and Luis Grodona</b> are
well known for dancing Canyengue, a form of Argentine tango that was popular
during the 1920s and early 30s that may or may not be accurately captured
by its current and recent practioners.&nbsp; From his memories of his parents'
generation of dancers, Luis has recreated his vision of the style.&nbsp;
The embrace is close and in an offset V; the dancers typically have bent
knees as they move; and the woman does not execute a cross.&nbsp; The steps
are short and frequently executed in the stacatto rhythm that is characteristic
of the tango music played by the old guard.&nbsp; Although Grodona's Canyengue
uses somewhat different figures than that of Ruben Terbalca or the late
Rodolfo Cieri (who are also known for the style), it corresponds quite
well to the dancing of other older tango dancers from outlying districts
and cities who learned tango as children.

<p><i class="rate star5"></i><a NAME="Anton/Grodona_cayengue"></a>Martha
Anton and Luis Grodona — <i>Asi Se Baila Canyengue I &amp; II</i> (2 video
tapes)
<br>Produced by Solo Tango, this outstanding two-video series well captures
the Canyengue of Martha Anton and Luis Grodona.&nbsp; The first video covers
the embrace, a basic step called "el horqueta," and 11 other step patterns.
The second video offers nine more advanced step patterns.&nbsp; All of
the patterns are taught as elements to be added to the horqueta.&nbsp;
Instruction is clear and concise, covering the step patterns, the footwork,
and the lead and the follow.&nbsp; Instruction is primarily provided in
Spanish with English subtitles, supplemented by voice over in English.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The leading that comes from leg flexion is not explained and occasionally
aspects of the instruction depart from the demonstration dances.&nbsp;
Martha and Luis exhibit strong rhyhtmic drive and great musicality in their
numerous exhibition dances.&nbsp; The video would be most useful for those
who want a look at tango's history.&nbsp; A few of the step patterns could
be adapted to milonguero-style tango.&nbsp; Possibly available from Zival's

<p><a NAME="Avellaneda"></a>The late <b>Pepito Avellaneda</b>
was a well-regarded milonguero who had many students.&nbsp; He was
particularly well-known for his style of dancing milonga.

<p><i class="rate star5"></i><a NAME="Avellaneda_milonga"></a>Pepito
Avellaneda — <i>Asi Se Baila Milonga</i> (3 videos or DVDs)
<br>From Solo Tango, this well produced video series captures much of the
the milonga of Pepito Avellaneda.&nbsp; The first volume is a wonderful
homage to Pepito, containing archival footage of the maestro's dancing
and interviews of Pepito and some of his many friends.&nbsp; Volumes 2
and 3 are instructional, with volume 2 providing coverage of beginning
and intermediate step patterns in Pepito's style and volume 3 providing
coverage of advanced steps in his style.&nbsp; After opening with Pepito's
advice on posture, the embrace, and the salida, volume 2 covers 10 step
patterns that quickly proceed from some basics to more challenging material.&nbsp;
For most patterns, Pepito demonstrates the figures with Dolores De Amo
or Suzuki and carefully explains the movements in Spanish with English
subtitles.&nbsp; That is followed with details of the man's steps, the
woman's steps, the man's footwork, and then woman's footwork as descibed
by voice over and variously shown by Pepito, Dolores, Suzuki, Fernando
Soleau or Mariana Bonavente.&nbsp; To round out the instruction for each
step pattern, voice over provides a brief description of the lead as demonstrated
by Pepito, Pepito gives some advice on learning or using the step pattern,
and then he dances a fairly lengthy demonstration with Dolores and Suzuki
usually only the step patterns taught to the point.&nbsp; Volume 3 continues
in the same format to provide coverage of 10 additional step patterns,
most of which contain double-time elements.&nbsp; In both videos, the material
is interesting, instruction is clear and well paced, and many of the demonstration
dances will have viewers wanting to get up and dance milonga with Pepito.&nbsp;
Although the instructional videos start with the basics, they are probably
best suited to those who have at least some knowledge of milonga.&nbsp;

She studied theater for five years with the directors Agust&iacute;n Alezzo

the Art School of the Salvador University.&nbsp; She has applied all this
knowledge to tango by developing an approach where the essence of tango
essence and its structural analysis are joined together.&nbsp; Her classes
consist of making, creating and learning tango movements based on the equality
of the woman and man in the dance.

<p><a NAME="Bottomer"></a><b>Paul and Elaine Bottomer</b> seem admirable
in their willingness to swim upstream against the British ballroom dance
establishment and abandon the strictures of ballroom tango for <i>Tango
Argentino</i>, where the parameters of acceptability are socially defined,
and no single technique reigns.&nbsp; Having danced in a number of competitions
sponsored by the International Dance Organization (Switzerland), Paul and
Elaine Bottomer claim to be European and world champions of Tango Argentino,
but the graceless and inauthentic dance technique demonstrated on their
one available video suggests very weak competition.&nbsp; Certainly authenticity
was not required to win the competitions.

<p><i class="rate pass"></i><a NAME="Bottomer_tango"></a>Paul
and Elaine Bottomer — <i>Tango Argentino</i>
<br><a href="#sansour">Emile Sansour</a> once suggested that British Tango
compares to the Argentine Tango about the same way that British beef compares
to Argentine beef.&nbsp; In this video, British couple Paul and Elaine
Bottomer do nothing to dispel the notion that the British Tango scene could
be in the grip of mad-cow disease.&nbsp; In the book that accompanies this
video, Paul Bottomer writes, "There is now an opportunity for the Dancing
Profession to guarantee the integrity and character of the real Tango with
its nostalgia and mystery, its drama and passion, the Tango Argentino."&nbsp;
Unfortunately neither the video, nor the accompanying book and CD have
captured authentic Argentine Tango.&nbsp; The video and the book offer
instruction that combines ballroom and fantasia elements with salon-style
Argentine Tango.&nbsp; Students with a sufficient knowledge of Tango to
recognize the differences will find little to learn in this mercifully
short video.&nbsp; The music on the CD lacks the cry of a bandoneon and
is not particularly suitable for dancing.&nbsp; Available from <a href="http://bdsweb.ballroom.com/index.htm" target="new">Bill

Copello and Alicia Monti — <i>How to Tango</i> (4 tape set)
<br>In this very well-produced set of videos, Carlos and Alicia offer detailed
instruction rather than the extensive coverage of steps that characterize
most instructional videos.&nbsp; The instruction starts with the basic
(with and without an initial back step) and progresses through 12 figures
in the first two videos.&nbsp; The third and fourth videos together offer
seven sophisticated combinations.&nbsp; Instruction covers the details
of each figure and pattern including lead and follow.&nbsp; Carlos and
Alicia also explain and demonstrate improvisation, but offer no direct
instruction in improvisational skills.&nbsp; Some viewers may be disappointed
by the slow pace of instruction and with the limited number of figures
that are covered in each video.&nbsp; All would be advised to ignore Carlos'
instruction to lead with the right hand.&nbsp; Fortunately, he ignores
his own instruction.&nbsp; Adam Boucher (director of <i>Tango: The Obsession</i>)

<p><a NAME="Copes"></a><b>Juan Carlos Copes</b> is widely regarded as one
of the great masters tango fantasia in the latter half of the 20th century.&nbsp;
He had a long partnership with Maria Nieves dancing in shows from the 1950s
through the 1980s, including the show <i>Tango Argentino</i> which is widely
credited for reviving popular interest in tango as a dance form.&nbsp;
Copes was recently acclaimed as the dancer of the century by the City of
Buenos Aires and Buenos Aires Athenaeum.&nbsp; He also was honored at the
American Film Choreography Awards for his choreography in the Carlos Saura
movie, <i>Tango</i>.&nbsp; His daughter Johana is an excellent tango dancer
in her own right and appeared in the movie, <i>Tango</i>.

<p><i class="rate star3_5"></i><a NAME="Copes_tango"></a>Juan
Carlos Copes (with Johana Copes) — <i>Tango and Milonga</i> (video tape
or DVD)
<br>In this 45 minute video, maestro Copes is assisted by his daughter
Johana in teaching and demonstrating essential elements of his tango and
milonga style.&nbsp; Both Copes and his daughter have a very strong presence
on the video, and the way they hold themselves and move with clarity and
grace is impressive and instructive.&nbsp; The well-produced video opens
with a demonstration tango and then covers ten steps and figures in a little
less than half an hour.&nbsp; Instruction in tango starts with the basics
(including two salidas with the back step) and progresses to an intermediate
combination.&nbsp; Those of who taken workshops from Copes in the past
will recognize most of the steps.&nbsp; For some of the tango steps, Copes
and his daughter demonstrate the steps individually before demonstrating
them in an embrace.&nbsp; In doing so, they highlight the quality of balance
and movement that is required.&nbsp; Voice over explains all the tango
movements, but the lead, follow and movement technique are not covered
in any detail.&nbsp; After the tango segments, Copes and his daughter dance
a milonga and then take less than 15 minutes to cover ten useful intermediate
steps and figures in milonga.&nbsp; Voice over names the milonga step or
figure, and Copes and his daughter are shown demonstrating it several times
from a variety of angles.&nbsp; The milonga segments are not instruction,
but they are instructive.&nbsp; The rating is a composite of four stars
for the tango segments and three stars for the milonga segments.&nbsp;
Those who are capable of learning simply by watching may want to add a
star to the milonga rating and a half star to the overall rating.&nbsp;
The videos are available in Spanish and English in both PAL and NTSC format.&nbsp;
A DVD in NTSC format that includes extensive footage of Copes' performances
along with the instructional material is also available under the title

Cot&eacute; and George Garcia — DVIDA Bronze, Silver and Gold Argentine
Tango Syllabuses (3 DVDs)
<br>In this series of videos, Christy Cot&eacute; and George Garcia offer
comprehensive instruction in salon-style Argentine tango starting from
the most basic figures and continuing through advanced figures and patterns.&nbsp;
The videos support a comprehensive syllabus for learning Argentine tango,
but stand independently of the certification that could be obtained through
the syllabus.&nbsp; Although Christy and George are careful to explain
that Argentine tango is an improvisational dance, the instruction emphasizes
learning tango through the mastery of figures rather than improvisational
techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp; The instruction is clear and comprehensive, but
production values are average and the videos are not entertaining to watch,
as Christy and George move slowly and explain each movement in what some
will consider excrutiating detail.&nbsp; Many viewers will be disappointed
that these videos only include exhibition snippets based on the taught
elements and no full demonstration dances.&nbsp; Available from

Cot&eacute; and George Garcia — Argentine Tango Follower's Technique (DVD)
<br>In this nearly two-hour video, Christy Cot&eacute; is assisted by George
Garcia in teaching follower's technique for the basic movements of Argentine
tango.&nbsp; Christy's instruction is animated, clear and comprehensive.&nbsp;
She covers follower's technique in embrace, walking, cuzada, forward and
backward ochos, molinetes (giros), boleos, paradas, blocks, sandwiches,
pasadas, barridas, ganchos, enganches, sacadas, points, planeos, calecita,
carpa, change of direction in turns, volcada, colgada, surprising moves
and embellishments with some overlap with technique taught on the <a href="#Cote_salon">DVIDA
Syllabuses</a>.&nbsp; Mastery of the skills taught on this excellent video
would give any beginning to intermediate follower a solid foundation for
dancing Argentine tango.&nbsp; Many viewers will be disappointed that the

Cot&eacute; and George Garcia — Argentine Tango Leader's Technique (DVD)
<br>In this nearly two-hour video, George Garcia is assisted by Christy
Cot&eacute; in teaching elements of leader's technique for Argentine tango.&nbsp;
Covering embrace, walking, cuzada, forward and backward ochos, molinetes
(giros), boleos, paradas, blocks, sandwiches, barridas, ganchos, enganches,
sacadas, points, planeos, calecita, carpa, change of direction in turns,
volcada, colgada and and embellishments, George's instruction consists
of working through the same elements of dance covered in <a href="#Cote_follower">Argentine
Tango Follower's Technique</a> and offering a variety of hints about leader's
steps and leading.&nbsp; A subtle and smooth leader, George takes a slow
pace in teaching with extensive demonstration that sometimes just consists
of teaching the step pattern.&nbsp; George fails to provide an overall
view of what is required of the leader, but he gives lengthy and detailed
explanations of movement.&nbsp; At times these explanations are convoluted
and unfocused.&nbsp; At other times, George may provide the very insight
necessary for a leader to dance Argentine tango well.&nbsp; George closes
the video with a few useful but rambling explanations of milonga etiquette
in Buenos Aires.&nbsp; Many viewers will be disappointed that the video
lacks a demonstration dance.&nbsp; Available from

<p><i class="rate star5"></i><a NAME="Cote_improvisation"></a>Christy
Cot&eacute; and George Garcia — The Art of Improvisation (DVD)
<br>Argentine tango is an improvisational dance built on an underlying
structure.&nbsp; In this oustanding video, Christy Cot&eacute; and George
Garcia teach the underlying structure of Argentine tango and the basics
of improvisation utilizing that structure.&nbsp; The first 75 minutes of
instruction is at the beginning level.&nbsp; Instruction starts with six
elements of the woman's movements—walks, cruzada, forward ochos, backward
ochos, turns and boleos.&nbsp; After teaching these elements, Christy and
George work with tips to improve skills, such as changing weight, collecting
feet, pivot, pause, double-time elements, and commonalities in the elements.&nbsp;
After teaching the first layer, Christy and George demonstrate the difference
between the parallel and crossed systems, how each element is led, and
how the leader's footwork complements the follower's.&nbsp; The final 35
minutes covers more advanced elements including paradas, frenos, mordidas,
barridas, ganchos, enchanche, sacadas, planeos, calecita, volcadas and
colgadas.&nbsp; These numerous elements are covered relatively quickly,
and the emphasis is placed on showing how these elements relate to the
six basic elements of tango.&nbsp; Overall, the teaching is clear and comprehensive.&nbsp;
This outstanding video would be great for a beginner, intermediate or anyone
who wants to improve their improvisational skills by developing an understanding
of the underlying structure of tango.&nbsp; Available from

<p><i class="rate star4_5"></i><a NAME="Cote_milonguero"></a>Christy
Cot&eacute; and George Garcia — Milonguero-Style Argentine Tango (2 DVDs)
<br>In this two-video series, Christy Cot&eacute; and George Garcia offer
comprehensive instruction in milonguero-style Argentine tango, starting
from the embrace and walk and continuing through the most basic elements
and some advanced patterns.&nbsp; Once mastered, all of the material is
likely to prove useful for dancing in crowded venues.&nbsp; The first video
covers the embrace, basics of walking, ocho cortado, back ochos, basic
left turns, sacada from cross system basic, right turn, molinete (giro)
left, molinete (giro) right, boleo and spiral cross, and progressive left
turn.&nbsp; The second video covers, running step, point and pivot, barrida,
enganches, outside partner left, carpa, turns, volcada and colgadas.&nbsp;
Although Christy and George assume some basic familiarity with Argentine
tango, their instruction is clear and comprehensive, if sometimes a little
to detailed and longwinded.&nbsp; Much of the material is taught in relatively
small step patterns, but the dancers who expect to use the material to
dance socially in a crowed venue will have to go beyond rote memorization
of the patterns to a mastery of the individual elements from which the
patterns are constructed.&nbsp; For some of the basic elements, the instructors
are careful to explain the importance of moving along the line of dance
and how to make adjustments to accomodate the presence of other dancers
on a crowded dance floor.&nbsp; Such explanations disappear as the material
grows in complexity.&nbsp; Many viewers will be disappointed that these
videos only include exhibition snippets based on the taught elements and
no full demonstration dances.&nbsp; Strangely, all the exhibition snippets
are danced to Di Sarli which works against the rhythmic drive that often
characterizes milonguero-style tango.&nbsp; Available from

<p><i class="rate star3"></i><a NAME="Cote_milonga"></a>Christy
Cot&eacute; and George Garcia — Argentine Milonga (2 DVDs)
<br>In this two-video series, Christy Cot&eacute; and George Garcia teach
a collection of step patterns, starting with basic elements of milonga
and working through to some more complex elements.&nbsp; The first video
starts with the baldosa box and offers 14 additonal step patterns as variations
from or elements to be added to the baldosa box including ochos, some traspie
elements, zig zags, grapevine, a right turn left turn combination and a
gancho.&nbsp; The second video offers 14 more advanced step patterns, including
amagues, double-time steps and more traspie elements.&nbsp; Some patterns
contain steps that move against the line of dance.&nbsp; For those who
already know Argentine tango, the instruction is clear and comprehensive,
and the production values are good, but the videos are not at all entertaining
to watch.&nbsp; Offering occasional insights, Christy and George move slowly,
carefully explaining each movement in what some will find to be excrutiating
detail.&nbsp; In their dancing and teaching, Christy and George capture
little of the rhythmic drive, playfulness and improvisation that characterizes
milonga.&nbsp; Stripped of these characteristics, the milonga that is presented
loses authenticity.&nbsp; Ballroom dancers who wish to learn milonga, may
find these videos create a bridge from ballroom sensibilities to milonga.&nbsp;
Many viewers will be disappointed that the first video has no full demonstration
dance.&nbsp; Most viewers will be disappointed by the full demonstration
dance that ends the second video.&nbsp; Available from

<p><i class="rate star4"></i><a NAME="Cote_vals"></a>Christy
Cot&eacute; and George Garcia — Argentine Vals (2 DVDs)
<br>In this two-video series, Christy Cot&eacute; and George Garcia offer
basic and intermediate instruction in vals.&nbsp; The first video starts
with an extensive explanation and demonstration of the rhythmic elements
of vals.&nbsp; After working with the rhythmic elements, Christy and George
proceed with what they call "the progressive cross system basic" and then
teach nine figures as variations from or elements to be added to the progressive
cross system basic.&nbsp; The second video stands alone (without much reference
to the progressive cross system basic) and offers instruction in 12 additional
step patterns, many of which are interesting.&nbsp; On both videos, most
of the figures work well, but several figures contain elements that move
against the line of dance.&nbsp; Some of the figures combine many elements,
and particularly on the first video most students would be better served
by instruction in smaller elements of movement.&nbsp; For those who already
know Argentine tango, the instruction is generally clear.&nbsp; Christy
and George move slowly and explain each step pattern in careful detail,
though not always accurately.&nbsp; Most of the figures are taught in an
open embrace, but Christy and George switch back and forth between open
and closed embraces as they demonstrate the step patterns to music.&nbsp;
Oddly, they say the back ocho they teach in volume one works only in a
close embrace.&nbsp; Their dancing suggests that Christy and George are
more comfortable dancing vals in a close embrace without double-time elements.&nbsp;
Each video ends with a demonstration dance based on the taught elements.&nbsp;

<p><i class="rate star2_5"></i><a NAME="Cote_fantasia"></a>Christy
Cot&eacute; and George Garcia — Tango Fantasia&nbsp; (2 DVDs)
<br>In this two-video series, Christy Cot&eacute; and George Garcia teach
a collection of step patterns that are much better suited for exhibition
dancing than social dancing.&nbsp; Most of the elements are small in scale
suggesting an exhibition in a salon rather than on a stage.&nbsp; Though
most of the elements are challenging, the overall content is a little dull.&nbsp;
The numerous closing elements and slicing entrada stand out as the most
interesting.&nbsp; Instruction is generally clear, but it assumes that
the viewer has a good knowledge of tango.&nbsp; For each figure, Christy
and George provide a demonstration without music, show and explain the
man's steps, show and explain the woman's steps, and demonstrate the figure
to music.&nbsp; No instruction or comments are offered about what is required
in an exhibition—such as selecting music, projecting, dynamics, composition,
etc.&nbsp; The same lackluster exhibition closes both videos.&nbsp; Available

<p><i class="rate star3"></i><a NAME="Cote_carpa"></a>Christy
Cot&eacute; and George Garcia — Tango in Carpa with Volcadas (DVD)
<br>The volcada has emerged as one of the most popular elements of
Argentine Tango.&nbsp; This video begins with technique for Carpa (Spanish
for tent) or the leaning position and progresses into technique for a basic
forward volcada (spilling action) in a leaning position.&nbsp; Despite
a title implying a variety of volcadas, the video shows only one volcada
incorporated in a variety of step patterns.&nbsp; Instruction in the lean
and volcada is extremely clear and comprehensive, but the video grows tedious
as the viewer slowly realizes that the same lean and volcada are being
repeated over and over in a variety of different figures.&nbsp; The step
patterns may be of interest to some dancers, but many will wonder whether
a video with only one volcada is worth their money or viewing time.&nbsp;
The rating represents a compromise between the high-quality instruction
and the limited content.&nbsp; Available from

<p><i class="rate star4"></i><a NAME="Cote_volcadas"></a>Christy
Cot&eacute; and George Garcia — Strictly Volcadas&nbsp; (DVD)
<br>In this 105 minute video, Christy Cot&eacute; and George Garcia offer
instruction on backward and forward volcadas, 19 step patterns in which
volcadas are used, and a demonstration dance laden with volcadas.&nbsp;
Anyone who has an intermediate to advanced understanding of tango and wants
to learn volcadas will find that the video covers what seems to be nearly
every possible use of volcadas.&nbsp; Not every variation will appeal to
every dancer, but each dancer is likely to find several uses of volcadas
that appeal to him or her.&nbsp; For each figure, Christy and George provide
a demonstration without music, show and explain the man's steps, show and
explain the woman's steps, explain the techniques for men and women, and
demonstrate the figure to music.&nbsp; Instruction is generally clear,
but it assumes that the viewer has both a good familiarity with techniques
for dancing on the body and terms used in teaching tango.&nbsp; The latter
includes the knowing the difference between the cross and parallel systems
and knowing the numbering of steps in the eight-count basic and cross-foot
eight count basic.&nbsp; The instruction misses a few points that some
consider essential to good volcadas—planting the woman's supporting foot,
the man supporting the woman on his body, and the man supporting the woman's
back with his right arm.&nbsp; The concluding demonstration dance, which
is heavily laded with volcadas, shows how too many volcadas can reduce
the visual appeal of the dance.&nbsp; Available from

<p><i class="rate star4"></i><a NAME="Cote_colcadas"></a>Christy
Cot&eacute; and George Garcia — Strictly Colcadas&nbsp; (DVD)
<br>In this video, Christy Cot&eacute; and George Garcia offer instruction
in clockwise and counterclockwise colcadas, 15 step patterns in which colcadas
are used, and a dance demonstration laden with colgadas.&nbsp; Anyone who
has at least an intermediate understanding of tango and wants to learn
colcadas will find that the video covers many uses of the colgada.&nbsp;
Because there are essentially only two colgadas (clockwise and counterclockwise)
with minor variations, the instruction grows a bit repititious, but each
dancer is likely to find a use of a colgada that appeals to him or her.&nbsp;
For each figure, Christy and George provide a demonstration without music,
show and explain the man's steps, show and explain the woman's steps, explain
the techniques for men and women, and demonstrate the figure to music.&nbsp;
Instruction is generally clear, but it assumes that the viewer has a good
familiarity with the terms used in teaching tango.&nbsp; Available from

<p><i class="rate star2"></i><a NAME="Cote_ganchos"></a>Christy
Cot&eacute; and George Garcia — Strictly Ganchos and Enganches&nbsp; (DVD)
<br>Frequently people who are new to tango become obsessed with using ganchos
and enganches wherever they can.&nbsp; Although this video would seem to
be ideal, technique is extremely important to successful and safe ganchos
and enganches.&nbsp; For someone who has learned their technique elsewhere,
the video might provide a few good ideas about uses of ganchos and enganches.&nbsp;
In this video, Christy Cot&eacute; and George Garcia offer instruction
in numerous step patterns in which ganchos and enganches are used.&nbsp;
For each figure, Christy and George provide a demonstration without music,
show and explain the man's steps, show and explain the woman's steps, explain
the techniques for men and women, and demonstrate the figure to music.&nbsp;
Too much of the teaching is about the figures and not enough is about ganchos
and enganches themselves.&nbsp; As the result of his poor body and leg
positions, George frequently appears slightly off balance leading ganchos.&nbsp;
George occasionally fumbles when explaining the men's step patterns, and
for the ganchos themselves, he offers little instruction about the man's
body rotation or leg movements.&nbsp; Christy's instruction for all the
woman's movements are generally clear and more thorough.&nbsp; The techniques
demonstrated for enganches are generally better, but the explanations of
the men's parts remain shaky.&nbsp; Some of the enganche combinations are
downright silly and scary to imagine at a milonga.&nbsp; Available from

<p><i class="rate star5"></i><a NAME="Cote_boleos"></a>Christy
Cot&eacute; and George Garcia — Strictly Boleos&nbsp; (DVD)
<br>In this video, Christy Cot&eacute; and George Garcia offer instruction
in backward, forward and linear boleos for women, numerous step patterns
in which boleos work well, and a dance demonstration laden with boleos.&nbsp;
Anyone who has at least an intermediate understanding of tango and wants
to improve their command of boleos will find the video quite useful.&nbsp;
For each figure, Christy and George provide a demonstration without music,
show and explain the man's steps, show and explain the woman's steps, explain
the techniques for men and women, and demonstrate the figure to music.&nbsp;
Instruction is quite clear and thorough, particularly for the women's movements.&nbsp;

Cot&eacute; and George Garcia — Strictly Sacadas&nbsp; (DVD)
<br>In this video, Christy Cot&eacute; and George Garcia teach a variety
of sacadas incorporated in 19 different step patterns.&nbsp; Through the
figures, Christy and George provide a great overview of the many ways sacadas
can be used in tango, and anyone who has at least an intermediate understanding
of tango is likely to find mastering the figures will greatly expand their
dancing.&nbsp; Instruction on technique for sacadas is found throughout
the figures rather than a single section devoted to the subject.&nbsp;
For each figure, Christy and George provide a demonstration without music,
show and explain the man's steps, show and explain the woman's steps, explain
the techniques for men and women, and demonstrate the figure to music.&nbsp;
Some of the explanations of men's technique are a little vague, but instruction
is quite clear and thorough for the women's movements.&nbsp; Available

<p><i class="rate star4_5"></i><a NAME="estiloCentro"></a>Dolores
De Amo and Daniel Lapadula — <i>Tango Estilo del Centro</i> (3 volumes
on video tape; 2 volumes on DVD)
<br>This well-produced set of videos from Solo Tango covers club-style
tango.&nbsp; As taught by Dolores De Amo and Daniel Lapadula, club-style
tango is danced in an upright posture with a close embrace.&nbsp; Some
separation occurs during turns, and the use of double-time steps is at
the leader's discretion.&nbsp; The instructors are first-rate exponents
and teachers of the style.&nbsp; The series is designed for graduated learning
from the first video through the third, but the instruction assumes a prior
knowledge of Argentine tango.&nbsp; Each video contains about 15 elemental
steps or complex step patterns, with about four minutes coverage of each.&nbsp;
Most of the material is interesting, and Daniel and Dolores dance all of
them quite well.&nbsp; Daniel and Dolores demonstrate each element of the
material several times and explain most of it carefully, but the videos
are best suited to visual learners who use the rewind and slow-motion buttons
on their VCRs or DVD players.&nbsp; Given the complexity of much of the
material, the dancer who wants to use these videos to learn to dance socially
will have to go beyond rote memorization of the patterns to a mastery of
the elements from which the patterns are constructed.&nbsp; The dancer
who puts this much effort into learning will be well served by the completeness
of instruction offered in this series of videos.&nbsp; The first and second
videotapes each close with a demonstration dance.&nbsp; Instruction is
in Spanish with English subtitles.&nbsp; The videos were created using

<p><i class="rate star5"></i><a NAME="one_step_milonga"></a>Carolina
Zokalski and Diego Di Falco — <i>One Step Further: Milonga </i>(1 of 4
DVDs) <b>Possibly Discontinued</b>
<br>This DVD covers the elements of milonga that Carolina and Diego taught
in highly regarded workshops that they taught throughout North America
from 2001 to 2003.&nbsp; The video opens with an improvised milonga, as
an example of one way to put together the steps taught on the video.&nbsp;
After a brief explanation of how learn from the video, Carolina and Diego
demonstrate 11 step patterns, most of which would add to the milonga vocabulary
of many intermediate tango dancers.&nbsp; None of the combinations are
highly complex, but most are likely to prove challenging to intermediate
tango dancers.&nbsp; For each figure taught, Carolina and Diego provide
fast-paced, but careful coverage—dancing each figure twice to the music
of Color Tango.&nbsp; After demonstrating the pattern, they show the man's
and woman's parts in slow motion with voice-over descriptions in English
of each of the movements.&nbsp; The very short (27 minute) program was
shot in a studio with high-quality digital technology.&nbsp; Produced by

<p><a NAME="Gavito"></a>The late <b>Carlos Gavito</b> was principally known
for his role as the star of the long-running show <i>Forever Tango</i>.
<b>Marcela Duran</b> was his long time partner in <i>Forever Tango</i>.&nbsp; Exquisite
at dancing slow tangos, particularly those recorded by Pugliese, Gavito
and Marcela were legendary for their use of close-embrace salon-style tango
on the stage.&nbsp; Many of the elements of their dance were highly individualistic
and not taught by others.&nbsp; Recognized as a milonguero, late Gavito
taught his material for use in social dancing.

<p><i class="rate star4_5"></i><a NAME="un_tal_Gavito"></a>Carlos
Gavito with Marcela Duran — <i>Un Tal Gavito</i> (3 DVDs or video tapes)
<br>Produced by Solo Tango, this three volume series of one-hour videos
presents many of the social dance elements and techniques that Carlos Gavito
and Marcela Duran used on the stage.&nbsp; Although the series progresses
from beginning elements to more challenging material, it is intended for
those who have some experience dancing tango.&nbsp; Each video contains
three exhibition dances and 10 or more identified sections of instruction.&nbsp;
All instruction is in Spanish with English subtitles.&nbsp; The first volume
is by far the most compelling.&nbsp; Gavito and Marcela dance three beautiful
exhibitions to Pugliese.&nbsp; Just watching Marcela's technique and their
changes in timing and use of pauses are instructive in their own right.&nbsp;
Gavito and Marcela start by teaching relatively small elements that include
their embrace, salidas, and basic, but they quickly progress to more challenging
material.&nbsp; Their teaching is clear and careful with Gavito explaining
the step patterns and man's part and Marcela explaining the woman's part.&nbsp;
I cannot imagine a better instructional video.&nbsp; With expectations
set by the first volume, the second is a disappointment.&nbsp; In their
exhibition dances, Gavito and Marcela don't seem to reflect the music they
have selected—a relatively fast tango, a vals, and a milonga.&nbsp; The
figures taught on the second video are more complex, and the teaching is
less clear.&nbsp; Moreover, when Gavito and Marcela demonstrate these more
advanced elements at dance tempo, their dancing becomes much rougher.&nbsp;
Some of the sacadas are particularly rough, with Gavito kicking in his
displacements.&nbsp; The third volume is stronger than the second, but
doesn't quite scale the heights established by the first.&nbsp; The exhibitions
are better than on the second video, but not as magical as those on the
first.&nbsp; The first few elements of instruction are lengthy explanations
that boil down to suggesting that one dance tango simply and musically
and maintain the relationship with one's partner.&nbsp; The remaining eight
elements are relatively small step patterns that are sufficiently unique
to pose a mental challenge to some dancers.&nbsp; The teaching is relatively
clear but is sometimes drawn out or vague, particularly when the material
is complex.&nbsp; Overall, this series is best suited to those dancers
who already have some familiarity with tango and want to learn Gavito's
relatively unique steps and ideas and/or Marcela's technique.&nbsp; Though
many of the elements taught on all three videos can be used to dance socially,
Gavito shows little respect for the line of dance, and some work will be
required of those leaders who want to use the material to dance socially.&nbsp;
For those who are looking for a video that captures the magic of Gavito's
and Marcela's dancing, the first volume should be sufficient.&nbsp; Possibly available from Zival's

Paiva &amp; Susana — <i>Teach Argentine Tango</i>&nbsp; (DVD only)
<br>This solidly produced video is packed with nearly an hour of material
that captures the essence of Orlando Paiva's unique and elegant style.
The video is divided into three sections: basic, intermediate and advanced
with a total of 37 steps or combinations.&nbsp; Each of the steps or combinations
presented on the video is shown three times from different perspectives,
ending with a close-up of the feet.&nbsp; In addition, Orlando and Susana
perform three exhibition dances.&nbsp; The narration provides a concise,
simple description of each step with helpful comments on technique.&nbsp;
Some viewers may be put off by Orlando's somewhat different interpretation
of rhythm and the lack of drama in his dancing.&nbsp; Knowledgeable dancers
will find elegant, precise, slow movement and many of Orlando's ideas for
developing figures.&nbsp; Although the video starts with basic steps, the
material is probably best suited for intermediate to advanced dancers who
have already developed the ability to reinterpret or modify the figures
when dancing at a crowded milonga.&nbsp; If I have a reservation about
the video, it is that dancers of lesser skill may attempt to execute the
figures as they are shown without regard to the others with whom they are
sharing the dance floor.&nbsp; Add a half star if you want a documentary

Mingo Pugliese is regarded among the great tango educators of his generation.&nbsp;
He distilled the innovative concepts developed by "Petroleo" and Salvador
Sciana during the golden age of tango into eight-count right and left turns
(giros) that can be used as a frame of reference for all turning steps.&nbsp;
Together with his wife Esther, Mingo has taught many of the young tango
stars of today, including their son Pablo.&nbsp; Using what is now the
family method, Esther and Pablo teamed up for several highly successful
teaching tours of the United States including the Stanford Tango Weeks

"El Holand&eacute;s" and Rotraut Rumbaum — <i>Tango de Salon</i>&nbsp; (2 DVDs only)
<br>This two DVD series teaches salon-style tango using the eight count basic.&nbsp;
Dancers new to tango who master the material on these two discs can attain intermediate
skills.&nbsp; The first disc covers the eight-count basic, cortes, the embrace, back
and forward ochos, mordidas, some very basic turns, using elements of the step patterns
to improvise, some basics of moving to the music, and some basics of dancing at a
milonga.&nbsp; The second disc covers caminada (tango walking), variations on the
basic, body alignment, figures with ochos, pauses and firuletes, additional elements
of improvisation, some ganchos, and more giros including molinetes and sacadas.&nbsp;
The instruction focuses on learning tango through step patterns.&nbsp; Every step
pattern is shown with Ricardo and Rotraut together, then separately.&nbsp; Coverage
is from multiple angles including from above.&nbsp; Common errors are shown for nearly
every step.&nbsp; The instruction is very clear and quite complete, but viewers will
have to work out some of their own body mechanics, develop their own lead and follow
skills, and provide their own excitement.&nbsp; On the NTSC DVDs, the viewer can choose
one of eight languages—Spanish, English, German, French, Italian, Portugese, Japanese or
Korean—for a combination of dubbed and voice-over explanations.&nbsp; The first DVD is 130
minutes long.&nbsp; The second is 150 minutes long.&nbsp; The DVDs also include bonus
footage of Buenos Aires, real people dancing at milongas and demonstration dances.&nbsp;

"El Holand&eacute;s" and Rotraut Rumbaum — <i>Vals</i>&nbsp; (DVD only)
<br>For someone who already has a basic knowledge of Argentine tango (as
taught with the eight-count basic) and wants to learn vals, Ricardo and
Rotraut have produced a DVD that could prove to be the perfect place to
start.&nbsp; Their instruction covers a variety of step patterns and techniques
incorporating walks, ochos, a colgada, giros, enrosques, boleos and sacadas
as variations on the eight-count basic.&nbsp; Anyone who masters all the
material on the DVD should be quite comfortable dancing vals.&nbsp; The
extensive coverage is evidenced when Ricardo and Rotraut conclude their
instruction by dancing a demonstration that uses only the elements they've
taught without conveying any sense of limitation.&nbsp; When new material
is introduced, the instruction is quite careful and well explained.&nbsp;
In contrast, the instruction lacks detail for material that is covered
in Ricardo's and Nicole's <a href="#Ricardo/Nicole_curso">Curso de Tango</a>.&nbsp;
As such, the DVD would be most useful to someone who is just beginning
to learn&nbsp; vals but already has a basic understanding of tango as taught
with the eight-count basic.&nbsp; Without such knowledge of tango, the
instruction on many elements is likely to prove sketchy or incomplete.&nbsp;
Most viewers are likely to find occasional use of the slow-motion and rewind
buttons essential.&nbsp; The viewer can choose one of seven languages—Spanish,
English, German, French, Italian, Portugese and Japanese—for a combination
of dubbed and voice over explanations.&nbsp; The DVD also includes bonus
footage of vals dancing in Buenos Aires.&nbsp; Zival's

<p>Comprehensive instruction for beginning Argentine tango dancers includes
a number of essential elements.&nbsp; One is to see how tango is danced.&nbsp;
Another is to learn that tango is improvisational and to develop an understanding
of the structure from which the dance is constructed.&nbsp; Another is
to learn to move to the music.&nbsp; Another is to learn lead and follow
skills.&nbsp; Another is to learn principles of good form.&nbsp; Last is
to learn some beginning steps and patterns.
<p>None of the beginning videos take an integrated approach to these topics.&nbsp;
To get the most complete coverage, I generally recommend Christy Cot&eacute;'s
and George Garcia's <a href="#Cote_improvisation">The Art of Improvisation</a>

<h2>
<a NAME="Milonguero"></a>Videos about Milonguero-Style Tango</h2>
Tango is typically danced in a close embrace in the crowded clubs of central
Buenos Aires. One of these close-embrace styles is commonly known as "apilado-style"
in Buenos Aires and "milonguero-style" in the United States, but it can
also be referred to as caf&eacute;-, confiteria-, club- or salon-style.&nbsp;
Milonguero-style tango is characterized by a close chest-to-chest embrace
and the use of some double-time dance steps.&nbsp; Some dancers distinguish
between club- and milonguero-style tango.&nbsp; Club-style tango uses a
close but slightly offset embrace and has some double-time dance steps.&nbsp;
It also allows for a slight separation in turns, which permits a wider
variety of steps than the milonguero style.&nbsp; A growing number of instructional
videos are available in these styles.&nbsp; The individual reviews above
offer more information about the contents of each listed video.

Orillero-style tango may have been developed in the outlying neighborhoods
of and around Buenos Aires where there was more space on dance floors,
or it may have its origins in the streets of poor outlying tenements. Orillero-style
tango is characterized by highly rhythmic movement and playful space-consuming
embellishments and figures that do not always respect the line of dance.

<a NAME="Canyengue"></a>Videos about Canyengue-Style Tango</h2>
Canyengue was a dominant style of tango during the 1920s and early 30s,
but it was subsumed into other social styles during the golden age of tango.&nbsp;
No visual records exist of canyengue danced during its own era.&nbsp; Some
older milongueros have recreated the style from their memories of the way
their parents generation danced.&nbsp; Written records suggest some authenticity
in these recreated styles, but no one can know for certain how canyengue
was really danced.

most often is danced with less complicated movements.&nbsp; For those who

Vals (tango waltz) is one of three dances in the family of tango dances,
which includes tango, milonga and vals.&nbsp; Someone who dances tango
figures to the vals rhythm will do a very credible job of dancing vals,
but differences occur in the execution of double-time steps and in the
emphasis on turning steps over walking steps.&nbsp; One of the difficulties
that anyone new to tango waltz will have is in understanding how to dance
to the vals rhythm.&nbsp; Of the reviewed videos, only the first <a href="#Cote_vals">Cot&eacute;/Garcia</a>
video offers explicit instruction on dancing to the rhythm, but the demonstration
dances on the

all of the instructional videos document a particular style, but the following
videos are particularly noteworthy in documenting individual or influential
styles.&nbsp; I am particularly fond of the video documenting the highly
individual style of <a href="bridge_tango.html#Romero/Galla">Victor Romero

<a NAME="Other"></a>Other Video Resources</h2>
Many other instructional videos exist but are not readily available.&nbsp;
Quite a few tango instructors make tapes of their own teaching but restrict
distribution to their own students.&nbsp; In addition, organizers and others
have prepared video summaries of the instruction at various tango workshops,
weeks and weekends.&nbsp; For example, the Miami Tango Fantasy and the
Fandango de Tango have produced video tapes and DVDs covering the teaching
at the festivals.&nbsp; Danel and Maria also produced an extensive collection
of video tapes covering their own teaching and that of such notables as
Miguel Zotto &amp; Milena Plebs and Juan Carlos Copes &amp; Maria Nieves
teaching at various tango weeks.&nbsp; Most of these videos are only made
available to those who have attended the workshops, tango weeks, or weekends
on which the videos are based, but a few are more generally available.&nbsp;
All of these tango week and workshop videos are much more successful as
a reminder of what was taught rather than in offering complete instruction.
