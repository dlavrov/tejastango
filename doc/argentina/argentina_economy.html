About Argentina's Economic Problems</h1>
by Stephen Brown&nbsp; (February 2002)
<p>In the wake of the recent meltdown of the Argentine economy, many analysts
have promoted the view that the Argentine national character is somehow
responsible for the economic and political problems in Argentina.&nbsp;
(For example, see <i>The New York Times</i> article, "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/08/international/americas/08ARGE.html" target="new">Argentina
Paying Heavily for Squandering Blessings</a>.")&nbsp; Having met many Argentines
through tango, however, I must express skepticism about the premise that
the recurring economic and political problems in Argentina are the consequence
of a flawed national character.&nbsp; They are the consequence of flawed
economic and political system that has its roots in Argentina's history—not
the Argentine national character.
<p>The continuing inability of the government to live within its means
is the principal contributing factor for the current and past economic
problems in Argentina.&nbsp; In years past, the Argentine government simply
issued money to cover its deficits which led to rampant inflation.&nbsp;
In more recent years, the Argentine government borrowed money abroad to
cover its deficits.
<p>The inability of the Argentine government to live within its means is
not surprising, however.&nbsp; Argentina is a country known for poltical
and economic corruption.&nbsp; Government payments help support corruption,
and many Argentines organize their economic affairs to illegally avoid
paying taxes, sometimes justifying their actions as reducing the support
for a corrupt system.
<p>Some may argue that the Argentines have squandered opportunities and
are getting what they deserve because they are a nation of corrupt people
who repeatedly elect corrupt governments that continue to make Argentina
an international basket case.&nbsp; But, these arguments dispassionately
dimiss the resulting suffering as being the deserved consequence of human
actions.&nbsp; They also for granted a particular answer to the old question,
"Which came first, the chicken or the egg?"
<p>Survival in a country that is rife with corruption requires that citizens
develop skills that work well within a corrupt system.&nbsp; If police
are not paid enough, they will take bribes and work scams.&nbsp; Once individual
citizens develop the skills to survive in a corrupt system, however, they
will resist its change.&nbsp; Changing the system threatens their survival
because it obviates the skills they have developed to work the system.&nbsp;
Individuals may recognize that the end of corruption will improve things
for their grandchildren's generation, if the individuals and their children
are able to survive.
<p>Individuals are also likely to recognize their own individual actions
to end corrupt behavior will not eliminate a corrupt system.&nbsp; A person
who fails to act corruptly in a corrupt system is simply reduced to poverty.&nbsp;
The sum total of individual corrupt actions poses a dilemma for a society.&nbsp;
Each person in the society would be better off if all members of the society
no longer acted corruptly.&nbsp; Nonetheless, each member of the society
has plenty of reason to distrust and disrepect his fellow citizens and
recognizes that corrupt behavior will serve himself well whether or not
the society is corrupt.
<p>Some might it convenient to compare Argentina to a drug addict who refuses
to quit and is unwilling to accept the consequences of his actions.&nbsp;
But a country that is in the throes of corruption is not exactly like a
drug addict.&nbsp; It is more like a group of drug addicts, none of whom
are not allowed to quit using drugs unless they all quit at once.&nbsp;
To fully quit, individuals are forced to leave the country or accept a
certain amount of poverty for themselves and their children.
<p>In such a situation, it is easy to see the appeal of a "caudillo," a
strong man who can be a national savior.&nbsp; The people are looking for
someone who can deliver them from the collective madness of a system that
does not serve them, yet from which they are unable to quit individually.&nbsp;
A caudillo would be the answer to their collective prayer to God...
<p>In my opinion, the Argentine national character is better expressed
in tango—a music and dance that is rich and deep its cultural heritage
and allows individual expression from the mind, heart and soul...&nbsp;
The communication that is possible in this dance tells no lies...&nbsp;
As Nito Garcia once said, "Bailas como sos."&nbsp; (You dance who you are.)
