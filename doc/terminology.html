<p>This list is part of an ongoing effort to educate and assist the friends
and enthusiasts of Sacramento Tango in their pursuit of the lovely dance
called Tango.&nbsp; It is intended to be used as a tool for students to
use when encountering new or conflicting terms in class and should not
be viewed as a final authority on the subject.&nbsp; Major sources for

<p><b>Pronunciation Guide:</b>
<br>• In Buenos Aires 'll' or 'y' is pronounced 'zh', almost an English
'j';
<br>• a 'qu' sounds like the 'c' in cat;
<br>• a 'z' is pronounced like 's';
<br>• and a Spanish 'j' is a hard, throaty 'h' sound.

<a href="#milonga">milonga</a>.&nbsp;

<a NAME="8-count_basic"></a><b>8-Count Basic</b> (Academic Basic) — The
first figure usually taught to beginning students after the walking steps.&nbsp;
See <a href="#basico">Basico</a>.&nbsp; The 8-count basic includes elements
which are used throughout the dance, although the complete figure itself
is not much used for dancing socially.&nbsp; The name refers to counts
in music, however, the man is not constrained to rigidly mark a step on
each count or beat of the rhythm.&nbsp; He is free to hold or to syncopate,
or cut the beat, as the music moves him or as space on the floor around
him allows.&nbsp; The figure may be danced into or out of at various points
and is not always entered at the beginning and there are shortcuts within
the 8-count basic.&nbsp; For instance, the man may lead the lady from the
<a href="#cruzada">cruzada</a> at 5 directly to 2, or he may close his
left foot to his right without weight on 7 and step side left directly
to 2.&nbsp; So in actuality the positions which the dancers move through
at each step are numbered as reference points.
<p>In closed dance position, the steps are as follows:


<div class="panel panel-default">
<div class="panel-body">

<p>
1. The man settles his weight on his right leg, placing the
lady on her left, and holds.&nbsp; Or, variations: the man steps back right,
the lady forward left.&nbsp; Also, the man may settle on his right leg,
placing the lady on her left, quickly extending his left leg to his left
side to point then closing back to his right leg without weight, as the
lady mirrors his action with her right leg.&nbsp; Or the man may step through
with his right leg between the partners, leading the lady to mirror his
action (<a href="#espejo">espejo</a>) by stepping through with her left
leg, remaining in closed position although briefly resembling promenade
position.
</p>

<p>2. The man steps side left, the lady side right, with the man stepping
slightly further than the lady.
</p>

<p>3. The man steps forward right in outside right position keeping his
upper body turned toward the lady in contra-body, the lady back left paralleling
the man and also in contra-body.&nbsp; This is a common point of entry
to the figure which the ladies should be aware of.
</p>

<p>4. The man steps forward left, the lady back right stretching slightly
more and seeking the man’s center.
</p>

<p>5. The man closes his right foot to his left with weight and rotates
his upper body to face forward, leading the lady to cross her left foot
in front of her right with weight (<a href="#cruzada">cruzada</a>) as she
finishes moving back in front of the man. Many variations for the lady
begin from this position.
</p>

<p>6. The man steps forward left inside his partner (to her center), the
lady back right.
</p>

<p>7. The man steps side right, the lady side left.
</p>

<p>8. The man closes his left foot to his right with weight, the lady her
right foot to her left.
</p>

<p>Steps 1 through 3 (sometimes 1 through 5) are known as the <a href="#salida">salida</a>.&nbsp;
Steps 3 through 5 are known as "walking the lady to the cross."&nbsp; Steps
6 through 8 are known as <a href="#resolucion">resoluci&oacute;n</a>.

<p><a NAME="tango_fantasia"></a><b>Tango Fantasia</b> — This is a hybrid
<a href="#tango">tango</a>,
an amalgam of traditional tango steps, ballet, ballroom, gymnastics, ice-skating
figures, etc.&nbsp; This is what most people see when they buy tickets
for a tango show.&nbsp; The moves include all of the basic tango moves
plus, <a href="#gancho">ganchos</a>, <a href="#sacada">sacadas</a>,
<a href="#boleo">boleos</a>
of every kind, <a href="#sentada">sentadas</a>, kicks, leaps, spins, lifts,
and anything else that the choreographer and the performers think that
they can get away with.&nbsp; Alas, this style of dancing shows up from
time to time at the <a href="#milonga">milongas</a>, usually badly performed
by ill-behaved tango dancers and frustrated tango performers who insist
on getting their money’s worth even if they have to kick, step on, bump
into, or trip every other dancer on the floor.&nbsp; This behavior is NOT
socially acceptable.&nbsp; Also see Stephen Brown's
<a href="tango_styles.html">Styles
of Argentine Tango</a>.
<p><a NAME="tango_liso"></a><b>Tango Liso</b> — Literally, tango smooth:
A way of dancing <a href="#tango">tango</a> characterized by its lack of
fancy figures or patterns.&nbsp; Only the most "basic" tango steps and
figures, such as <a href="#caminada">caminadas</a>, <a href="#ocho">ochos</a>,
<a href="#molinete">molinetes</a>,
etc., are utilized.&nbsp; <a href="#boleo">Boleos</a>,
<a href="#gancho">ganchos</a>,
<a href="#sacada">sacadas</a>,
<a href="#sentada">sentadas</a>,
and other fancy moves and acrobatics are not done.&nbsp; A very early term
for <a href="#tango_de_salon">Tango de Salon</a>.
<p><b>Tanguero</b> — (feminine; Tanguera) Refers to anyone who is deeply
and seriously&nbsp; passionate about any part of <a href="#tango">tango</a>,
such as its history, music, lyrics, etc.&nbsp; In Argentina most tangueros
are scholars of <a href="#lunfardo">lunfardo</a>, music, orchestrations,
Gardel, etc.&nbsp; One can be a tanguero without being a <a href="#milonguero">milonguero</a>
and a <a href="#milonguero">milonguero</a> without being a tanguero (very
few <a href="#milonguero">milongueros</a> would be referred to as tangueros).&nbsp;
And of course, one can be an extremely good tango dancer without being
either, such as stage dancers, who are quite disdained by real <a href="#milonguero">milongueros</a>
and tangueros, unless they go the extra distance and become <a href="#milonguero">milongueros</a>
by going to the <a href="#milonga">milongas</a>, and/or tangueros as well.&nbsp;

(left or right) caressing the outside of the lady’s leg with his leg (as
in 3 of the <a href="#8-count_basic">8-count basic</a>), then crosses behind
himself which pushes the lady’s leg to cross in front.&nbsp; May also refer
to a jumping step from <a href="#tango_fantasia">tango fantasia</a> (stage
tango) where the lady swings her legs up and over with the second leg going
up as the first leg is coming down (frequently seen as an aerial entry
