<p>It's true that Argentina is in economic crisis, and the reverberations             
of the crisis are felt in every place, in every person, in every moment.&nbsp;
Foreign visitors will certainly see the eroding effects the crisis has
had on local Argentines, but this needn't prevent them from having an enjoyable
vacation.&nbsp; For tourists, the advantages of visiting Argentina far
outweigh the disadvantages.&nbsp; The advantage is mostly due the the devaluation
of the Argentine peso and the fact that the price of food, clothes, taxis
and some lodging are one-third or less than what they would be in dollars.&nbsp;
Imagine buying a pair of tango shoes for US$20.

<h3>
Some Safety Precautions</h3>

While I recommend visiting Argentina, Buenos Aires is somewhat more dangerous
than it used to be. I used to feel fairly safe walking around by myself
and waiting for the bus at 3 a.m. on a weekday.&nbsp; Now, I would only
do that if I had to because I didn't have taxi money.&nbsp; The streets
are a little less safe simply because there are fewer people out late at
night, and there are more impoverished and hungry people in the country
and in Buenos Aires.

<p>Be sensible under these circumstances—don't walk around alone at 3 a.m.&nbsp;
For foreigners, taxis are very inexpensive, and taking one to and from
destinations is probably the safest route late at night.&nbsp; I have read
in the newspapers that there have been situations where passengers have
been robbed by taxi drivers and accomplices.&nbsp; However, the number
of times I have heard of this happening is minuscule compared to the number
of people taking taxis every day and night without problems.

<p>I think that the likelihood of being assaulted or robbed in a taxi scam
is very low for most foreign tango tourists with some urban awareness.&nbsp;
For example, don't take a taxi sitting outside on the street if you have
just walked out of a bank, an American Express office, or any place where
you might be getting or changing money.&nbsp; In general, it's best to
hail a moving taxi rather than one that's sitting, unless it's a taxi sitting
outside a milonga.&nbsp; The milongas have taxi drivers who work for them
and those drivers are trustworthy.&nbsp; If you are going out at night
from a home, hotel or somewhere where there is a phone, calling a radio
taxi is the safest option.

<p>Keep in mind that phones generally are not available for public use
in most places.&nbsp; As a tourist, if you use your street smarts and keep
a low profile—don't wear fancy jewelry or fur coats, and don't flash wads
of cash—then the danger index for you is low.&nbsp; If you're concerned
about political uprising—the likelihood of one occurring is very low.&nbsp;
At most, you might see some demonstrations.&nbsp; If you do, the best thing
to do is stay away from them to avoid any complications.&nbsp; The city
is big enough that you should be able to do so.

<h3>
The Good News</h3>

The plus for tourists who visit now is the strength of the dollar.&nbsp;
Even though inflation is occurring, prices in Argentine pesos still end
up costing less for tourists with U.S. dollars or any currency of similar
value.&nbsp; Priced in foreign currency, clothes, restaurants and shoes(!)
are all one-third less than what they used to be.&nbsp; From what I can
see, tango shoes here are sold in pesos.

<p>It seems, however, that tango housing and hotels remain in dollars,
but prices are certainly reasonable.&nbsp; You also will be asked to pay
in dollars for private tango lessons with many teachers (especially those
who are more well-known), and the fee will be the same amount you would
pay in the United States.&nbsp; Group classes, however, are priced in Argentine
pesos and are extremely inexpensive when compared to those in the United
States.

<h3>
The Effect on the Tango Scene</h3>

How has the local tango scene been affected by the crisis?&nbsp; Unemployment,
inflation, and the increasing number of people living under the poverty
level (at least half the population) will no doubt affect any country's
social environment.&nbsp; But in the tango scene and the milongas, the
effects are not that obvious.&nbsp; Someone coming here for the first time
would never know the difference. Yes, the tango magazines are thinner and
harder to come by.&nbsp; Some locals will choose a night or two to go out
(probably on the weekend) as opposed to going out every night.&nbsp; But,
really, the only locals who ever went out every night anyway were newer
dancers in their fanatic stage or people who got free admission.&nbsp;
The latter people still get free admission and you'll still see them in
the milongas.

<p>There are plenty of milongas, and the ones I have attended recently
have been very crowded.&nbsp; Some milongas have closed; others have opened—nothing
different from the past five years I've lived here.&nbsp; For me, one of
the most distressing effects of the economic decline on tango is that many
of the best dancers have disappeared from the scene because they have been
forced to look for opportunity abroad.&nbsp; But, I find that the level
and variety of dancing here is still higher than in most U.S. cities.

<p>Regardless of how many people are in the milongas and what the level
of dancing is, Buenos Aires will always remain the heart and soul of the
tango.&nbsp; What one experiences here is unparalleled to the tango experience
anywhere else in the world.&nbsp; Economic crisis is part of it, and I
encourage foreigners to come here and talk to the local people—ask them
what is going on and how it is affecting them.&nbsp; In tango's history,
Argentina has gone through both good and bad times—all of it reflected
in tango's lyrics, music and dance.
