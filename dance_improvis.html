<h3> Argentine Tango Is Improvisational</h3>
Stage performances of Argentine tango are typically choreographed, and
choreographed tango can range from ballet with elements of tango to tango
with elements of ballet. In its purest form as a social dance, however,
Argentine tango is highly improvisational. Drawing from their knowledge
of tango's conventions, dancers construct phrases as they dance rather
than reproduce pre-set patterns. This degree of improvisation allows the
dancers to navigate crowded dance floors, as well as to express themselves
in a non-verbal manner.
<p>Beginners typically get their first taste of improvisation by choosing
patterns from a limited set of previously mastered figures. Choosing patterns
from a variety of figures, some of which are closely related, represents
a somewhat greater mastery of tango and more improvisational freedom. Choosing
patterns from a big variety of figures, many of which are closely related,
further increases the degree of improvisational freedom. A much greater
mastery of tango and more improvisational freedom is found in the ability
to break off patterns and switch to others without hesitation. The highest
degree of improvisational freedom is found in choosing individual steps
without regard to any pre-determined patterns.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Developing Improvisational Skills</h3>
Fluent improvisation requires a considerable mastery of tango's vocabulary.
As the dancer develops a greater knowledge of tango's vocabulary, the ability
to improvise may come naturally or it may need to developed. Improvisation
does require a bit of magic, but to a great extent improvisation is explainable,
analyzable, and doable.
<p>Nearly all of the steps, figures and patterns utilized in social Argentine
tango can be constructed from underlying structural elements that might
be considered the theory of tango dancing. These structural elements include
walks, turns, sandwiches, embellishments, and structural connections. Developing
a thorough understanding of these structural elements can greatly help
a dancer learn to improvise because the knowledge provides a pool of steps
that can be dipped into as needed. Understanding may come from continued
exposure to tango, but it can also be learned and nurtured.
<p>No single approach to improvisation is the truth, however. The truth
is in the dancing itself. Jazz great Charlie Parker once said, "Learn the
changes and then forget them." In dancing Argentine tango, the goal is
to get beyond the steps, figures, patterns, and theory to pure dancing
expression.
<p>Great improvisational tango dancers are not thinking ocho, ocho cortado,
molinete with a swirl close, or sixth step of the Pugliese turn. Nor are
they thinking parallel foot, double time, cross foot. The great dancers
have internalized the information to the point they no longer have to think
about much at all. They have learned how the steps, figures, patterns and
structural elements feel on a crowded dance floor.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Finding the Magic</h3>
On a crowded social dance floor, intuition is an important part of improvisation.
With spaces appearing and disappearing, dancers have a relatively brief
time to react. Consequently, navigation relies heavily on intuitive decision
making, rather than a deliberate sorting through the possible options before
making a decision.
<p>In this context, learning to improvise is largely a thinking process
in which the concentration of the conscious mind is used to educate the
unconscious mind about how tango is danced. Dancing tango socially is an
improvisational exercise in which the conscious and unconscious minds work
together to create a dance from the options one has learned. Relaxing and
enjoying the moment helps open the channels to the unconscious mind and
better enables one to dance in a creative flow.
<p>Improvisation is not purely a mental exercise, however. It also relies
heavily on a mind-body connection. The required movements must be learned
in the body, as well as the mind. Be aware of what your eyes see and your
body feels as much as you focus on the mental aspects of the dance, and
you will get beyond theory to a point where you can flow in the dance.
With an open heart, aim for a state of grace and communication with your
partner and others on the dance floor, and the dancing will flow out.
<p>When we dance Argentine tango on a crowded social dance floor, we take
the steps the floor offers, moving from one open space to another. When
large spaces open up on the dance floor, we may begin to execute one of
the more space-consuming figures we know that has few familiar exits. Dancing
this way, we find it completely possible to dance with a special partner
on the most crowded dance floor, surrender to the music, execute simple
steps, bypass the calculating mind, not crash into anyone, and enjoy the
moment in the most exhilarating manner.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Musicality and Improvisation</h3>
Fluent improvisation requires musical movement. Build a collection of tango
music and listen to it. The collection need not be large. When possible,
listen actively and practice moving to the music without a partner. In
addition to moving to the beat, find other elements in the music and move
to them. Learn to move in musical phrasing separated by pauses or other
closing elements.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Improving Improvisational Skills by Watching</h3>
You can improve improvisational skills by watching the better tango dancers
in action. Try to watch unobtrusively at milongas and practicas. Also consider
looking at demonstration dances on the many instructional videos that are
available, particularly those demonstration dances that are not intended
to draw explicitly on the figures taught on the video. In watching, look
for the beauty in the way the figures and patterns have been constructed
and the ways the structural elements fit together. Also watch how others
move to the music. Are they dancing to the beat, or to other elements in
the music? What kind of phrasing do they use, if any?
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Tango Instruction and Improvisation</h3>
In apparent contrast to the demands of learning improvisational skills,
most tango instructors teach figures and patterns. Only a few teach the
underlying structure from which steps and patterns are constructed. The
common approach may not seem like the most direct route to developing improvisational
skills, but those who teach step patterns have produced many fine tango
dancers who have good to excellent improvisational skills. Some of their
students have developed an intuitive feel for the structure of tango simply
through exposure to many different figures and patterns, and they began
to improvise without any formal training about structure. For these dancers,
formal instruction on the underlying structure of tango probably would
have accelerated the process of learning improvisational skills and gotten
them to fluency sooner.
<p>Rather than regard the two approaches as mutually exclusive, we see
them as complementary. We have found that understanding the structure of
tango greatly increases the ability of dancers to learn new figures, as
well as to improvise. Dancers who have developed a knowledge of the underlying
structure of tango find instruction in figures and patterns more useful.
For them, studying steps and patterns can become a process of learning
how the masters use elements from the structure to put patterns together.
The pedagogic process is similar to learning jazz music theory and then
studying how Miles Davis or John Coltrane played.
<p>When studying with someone who teaches Argentine tango through figures
and patterns, learn the steps, figures and patterns exactly as they are
taught. Look for the beauty in the way the figures and patterns have been
constructed and the ways the structural elements fit together. After learning
the new figures and patterns, look for ways to vary them. Soon aspects
of these figures and patterns will become part of your unconscious vocabulary.
<p>Unless you attempt to reproduce the figures on the social dance floor
exactly as you learned them in the classroom, you are unlikely to do so.
The conditions on the floor will be different than in the classroom. More
importantly your life experiences are different than your professors'.
