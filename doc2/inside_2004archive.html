Tom Stermitz writes:
<br>Tango music has a characteristic suspension and surge, often expressed
in the music as a rising crescendo prior to the strong beat at the start
of a phrase or even leading to individual beats.&nbsp; The bandoneon (resting
on the player's knee) often starts to express a note BEFORE the beat; then
the player slaps his foot to the ground causing a hrr-UMPPF sort of sound.&nbsp;
There are many other musical and rhythmic elements, but the above is most
distinctive to tango, and not present with such dramatic intensity in other
kinds of music, e.g. foxtrot, habanero, jazz or world music.&nbsp; A tango
dancer often expresses this hrr-UMPPF by surging slightly before the beat,
feeling the partner engage, then arriving to a footstep ON the beat.
<p>This is the same sound and movement that I previously described as Rhuummmp
in <a href="#0006">Rhuummmp and Ric Tic</a>.

<br>20 December 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>In the past month, I have danced tango and watched tango dancers in
four cities around the United States, including attending a big tango event.&nbsp;
One thing that I have seen in every city (including the big tango event)
was more than a few leaders who otherwise seem to have reasonably good
skills and a decent sense of rhythm but seem to dance exactly the same
way to every piece of music and with every partner.&nbsp; I am not referring
to styles—milonguero vs. salon vs. nuevo—as I wouldn't necessarily expect
a person to change their basic style of dancing for different pieces of
music.&nbsp; I mean leaders who ignored how the rhythmic signatures of
their movement related to the music and forced the same step patterns onto
whatever music was playing, whether it be Donato's A Media Luz, D'Arienzo's
El Flete, Tanturi's Cuatro Compases, Di Sarli's Bahia Blanca, Calo's Tristezas
de le Calle Corrientes, Pugliese's La Bordona or Color Tango's Zum.
<p>Obviously, the rhythmic signatures of many tango steps are sufficiently
elastic that their amplitude and frequency can be adjusted to reflect the
music.&nbsp; What I saw was a number of leaders who had the command of
advanced steps but were not making such adjustments.&nbsp; For example,
I saw one leader use the same volcada with every partner to every orchestra.&nbsp;
The way he executed the volcada fit well with slow, dramatic music, but
it didn't reflect the staccato rhythms of D'Arienzo.&nbsp; I wouldn't say
that he was off the rhythm, but that the movements did not well express
the rhythmic elements of the music.&nbsp; I saw another leader use the
same staccato turn with an ocho cortado that he used with all music, even
as the orchestra was taking a dramatic pause.&nbsp; Again, he wasn't off
the rhythm, but it was like watching a rapid-fire snare drum solo in what
would have otherwise been a delicious pause.&nbsp; In another case, I saw
a regional teacher continually using the same change of direction turn
without any adjustment to fit the cadences of the music.
<p>Of course, dancing tango as step patterns contributes to the problem,
but I am not referring to beginners or even intermediate dancers.&nbsp;
I think too many leaders are failing to develop their feeling for tango
music.&nbsp; In August, I listed <a href="#0063">Some CDs for Learning
About Tango Music</a>.&nbsp; Rather than just sitting down and listening
to the music, working with movement to simple <a href="#0006">Rhuummmp
and Ric Tic</a> rhythms can be a good way to get started.

<br>17 November 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>Let's consider two different tandas of vals music.&nbsp; Tanda One (all
played by Rodolfo Biagi): Amor y Vals, Paloma, Por Un Beso de Amor, Lagrimas
y Sonrisas.&nbsp; Tanda Two: Ilusion de Mi Vida by Orquesta Color Tango,
Palomita Blanca by Hector Varela, Corazon de Oro by Lalo Schifrin Orquesta,
Desde el Alma by Osvaldo Pugliese
<p>Both tandas contain devastatingly wonderful vals music.&nbsp; All pieces
of the music are eminently suitable for dancing, but the moods of the two
tandas music are considerably different.&nbsp; The valses played by Biagi
have a denser orchestration and more direct rhythm and romantic quality.&nbsp;
The valses in the second tanda have a more contemporary and spacious quality
and a lighter sense of romanticism.
<p>The embrace used to dance to these different tandas need not be different,
nor am I likely to decide to dance one style of vals to Biagi and another
to the more contemporary recordings in the second tanda.&nbsp; We are bound
to dance a little differently to these two tandas if our interpretation
comes from the heart and our connections with our partner, the music and
the other dancers around us.&nbsp; Nonetheless, our interpretations of
the music will depend to some extent on the style of dancing we gravitate
toward.
<p>Dancers who are caught up in executing complex memorized figures are
unlikely to offer anything that resembles a relationship to the music.&nbsp;
The execution of these complex figures can severely interfere with the
ability to focus on anything else.&nbsp; Beginners who are dancing relatively
simple elements are much more likely to connect to the differences in the
music.&nbsp; Those who approach tango as memorized figures are likely to
leave their first tango lesson and their next 20 less able to connect and
move to the music than they did when they first walked in the door.&nbsp;
That's not dancing.

<p>Alberto reports that El Arranque has unearthed old handwritten old arrangements
from the 1940s which they are using—some of them fairly radical, according
to Iganacio.&nbsp; These arrangements were buried in peoples closets, etc.&nbsp;
El Arranque is near completing a CD on which they play with the older masters
who composed the music, which Igancio says is unusual because tango recording
is not a very collaborative or open scene.&nbsp; The new El Arranque CD,

<br>12 October 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>In the 21st century, we have different social venues, new technologies,
new musical instruments, and continuing musical evolution.&nbsp; All of
these developments have inspired some of today's tango musicians to develop
new approaches to tango dance music.&nbsp; At the same time, tango dancers
are exploring new music for dancing.&nbsp; At an increasing number of milongas
in Buenos Aires, Europe and North America, the DJs have expanded their
playlists to include neo-tango music.&nbsp; Neo-tango consists of two genres
of music: tango-fusion and "alternative" tango music.&nbsp; Tango fusion
integerates traditional tango rhythms and instrumentation with other musical
traditions, contemporary instruments and often electronica to create a
modern and culturally relevant world tango music with a dance-club sound.&nbsp;
Alternative tango music is tango music from other traditions or non-tango
music that some dancers find interesting for dancing Argentine tango steps.
<p>I remain a skeptical about the use of non-tango music for dancing Argentine
tango, but an increasing number of tango-fusion recordings have found their
way onto my playlist.&nbsp; I find it best to use such recordings late
at night and sparingly.&nbsp; Some of the tracks to consider playing at
milongas are:
<p>Carlos Libedinsky — Narcotango
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vi Luz y Subi
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plano Sequencia
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otra Luna
<br>La Chicana — Tango Agazapado

I do not understand many of the lyrics in the songs that I dance to.&nbsp;
I think, how can I dance, how can I express this if I don't know what it
is about.&nbsp; Certainly I can express myself, but the music is something
I still to learn.
<p>"But another thing is you might as well be asking how long it takes
for someone to be a good lover, a good artist, a good musician, a good
listener.&nbsp; These are all requirements of being a good tango dancer
in my estimation.&nbsp; There are probably no answers to this question.
<p>"I once asked Graciela Gonzalez about embelishments.&nbsp; She told

it didn't matter that the dance changes with a person's experiences and
that what I draw from now will be different in time, that I won't hear
or think things in the same way as time passes.
<p>I may be waxing philosophical now, but I think it best not to measure
one's life by means of standards and proficiencies.&nbsp; The joy of doing
something comes from the doing.&nbsp; Dancing is an art form in which nothing
is created except for the experience.&nbsp; If your goal is to have a good
experience then your outlook can change.&nbsp; You don't view people as
good dancers or bad, but as potential persons with whom to connect, to

<p>Argentine tango made a comeback from near oblivion in the 1980s, but
it was really the 1990s and early 2000s when Argentine tango reached its
current level of participation.&nbsp; With its relatively recent revival
and niche market, Argentine tango has something that is relatively unique
in the dance world—beginners taught by masters.&nbsp; Such interactions
can be difficult and lead to strained expectations on both sides.&nbsp;
From time to time, a relatively inexperienced dancer will offer negative
comments on <a href="http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/" target="new">Tango-L</a>
or another forum about the trouble that they had while taking classes or
lessons from a master whose teaching was beyond their ability to learn.&nbsp;
And from time to time, highly skilled dancers who are teaching Argentine
tango have difficulty understanding that many of their students are learning
to dance Argentine tango as a diversion from their daily lives.&nbsp; Saludos

<br>&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Anibal Troilo — Instrumental (Tango Argentino BMG-RCA)
- his early rhythmic instrumental classics
<br>&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Troilo/Fiorentino (Solo Tango BMG-RCA) - Troilo with
the great vocalist Francisco Fiorentino
<br>&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Osvaldo Pugliese — Ausencia (EMI Odeon) - an outstanding
collection with many of Pugliese's best recordings
<br>&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; Miguel Cal&oacute; — Al Comp&aacute;s del Corazon (EMI
Reliquias) - great valses, milongas and tangos with the great vocalist
Raul Beron
<br>&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; Ricardo Tanturi/Alberto Castillo — El Tango es el Tango
(Tango Argentino BMG-RCA) - the Tanturi/Castillo CD with the most classic
tangos
<br>&nbsp; 8.&nbsp; Carlos Di Sarli — Porte&ntilde;o y Bailarin (Tango
Argentino BMG-RCA) - with vocalist Jorge Duran
<br>&nbsp; 9.&nbsp; Angel D'Agostino y Angel Vargas — Tangos de Los Angeles
vol. 2 (Tango Argentino BMG-RCA)
<br>10.&nbsp; Rodolfo Biagi — Solos de la Orquesta (EMI Reliquias)

of his instrumental classics
<br>12.&nbsp; Ricardo Tanturi/Enrique Campos — Una Emoci&oacute;n&nbsp;

<p>With this 12 CD collection, you would have good coverage of all five
styles of golden-age tango music played by the orchestras whose music is
most frequently played at milongas including the hard rhyhmic tangos of
Juan D'Arienzo and Rodolfo Biagi; the soft rhythmic tangos of Anibal Troilo,
Anibal Troilo with Francisco Fiorentino, Ricardo Tanturi with Alberto Castillo
and Angel D'Agostino with Angel Vargas; the smooth Carlos Di Sarli instrumentals,
the lyrical tangos of Miguel Cal&oacute; with Raul Beron, Carlos Di Sarli

<br>20 August 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>La Yumba is one of the most famous tangos recorded by Osvaldo Pugliese's
orchestra, but the word "Yumba" cannot be found in a Spanish-language dictionary.&nbsp;
In fact, Yumba is an onomatopoeiac reference to the strong rhythmic element
played on the bass in that piece of music.&nbsp; The sound is created by
a slide on a string combined with a striking of the body of the bass.&nbsp;
Pugliese used this strong rhythmic element in many of his recordings, and
it and became a defining characteristic of his most well-known recordings.&nbsp;
According to tango historian Ruben Terbalca, "Negro Thompson" pioneered
this approach to the bass in 1912 to imitate African percussion while playing
a style of music known as "toque canyengue."&nbsp; As first used, it was
a quick percussive element.&nbsp; Some 30 years later, Pugliese slowed
it way down to create the familiar and defining Yumba beat.

<br>In leaves no step had trodden black.

<br>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
<br>I doubted if I should ever come back.

<p>"In my experience as a dancer, musicality is the most important thing
a dancer has to offer, leader or follower.&nbsp; Good technique matters,
but without musicality the dance suffers.&nbsp; I have danced with women
whose technique was not great, but whose musicality was so strong that
they were a delight to dance with.&nbsp; I don't particularly enjoy dancing
with someone whose technique is great but whose musicality is weak.
<p>"In my own dancing what it means to dance well changes with the years.&nbsp;
My experience of the dance is deeper and richer now after dancing tango
for nearly 9 years.&nbsp; Each year I seem to learn something significant
that takes my dancing to another level, the last two years especially.&nbsp;
Each year I know the music better, and feel more layers and more subtle
things.&nbsp; This deeper feeling of the music changes my dancing for the
better.&nbsp; I hope this process never ends for me.
<p>"Every person will progress at their own rate.&nbsp; What some can do
in one year, it will take others three years to do.&nbsp; People can get
so worried about how quickly, or not quickly they are progressing that
they may forget to enjoy where they are.&nbsp; There is, hopefully, no
end to the learning so in the end it doesn't matter so much how quickly
one learns."

a subset of rudimentary tango steps safely and considerately around the
floor in typical 'milonga conditions' in close and open embrace (based
on our experience).
<p>"<b>4-6 months</b> — the point in an aspiring tango dancer's education
that several well-known Argentine instructors defined for me as the time
to shift in primary focus away from 'step vocabulary' toward an <i>intensive</i>
immersion into tango music — in the car, in the shower, at work, at home,
etc.
<p>"<b>5 months</b> — the typical length of time Carlos Gavito suggested
it would take a reasonably talented follower, if she worked hard with good
leaders, to become 'good.'
<p>"<b>2 years</b> — an initial period of time at the start of the local
Colorado tango community that a well-known local instructor described as
'beginners teaching each other their mistakes.'
<p>"<b>2 years</b> — the length of time Mariano 'Chicho' Frumboli's current

world-class tango teaching/performing couple.

<br>22 June 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>Interesting to think about the variations of the word "new" that are
currently in use by Argentine tango dancers.&nbsp; <b>New Tango</b> is
used to refer to the music of Astor Piazzolla and the contemporary orchestras
who follow his approach by relying heavily on rubato playing and abrupt
tempo changes to create their dramatic effects.&nbsp; <b>Nuevo Tango</b>
refers to a pedagogic approach to tango dancing developed by Gustavo Naveira
and Fabian Salas that emphasizes a structural analysis of the dance in
which previously unexplored combinations of steps and new figures can be
found.&nbsp; It can also mean the style of dancing that comes from that
analysis.&nbsp; <b>Neo Tango</b> refers to two genres of music that are
used for dancing tango: tango fusion and "alternative" tango.
<p><b>Tango Fusion</b> integerates traditional tango rhythms and instrumentation
with other musical traditions, contemporary instruments and electronica
to create a modern and culturally relevant world tango music with a dance-club
sound.&nbsp; Some of the better-known tango-fusion artists are Gotan Project,
Bajofondo Tango Club, and Carlos Libedinsky.&nbsp; <b>Alternative Tango</b>
is the term used to describe tango music from other traditions or non-tango
music that some dancers find interesting for dancing Argentine tango steps.

<br>3 June 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>Controversial from its beginnings, techno tango (also known as tango
fusion and neo tango) mixes machines with tango to give birth to a polemic
2x4 techno sound.&nbsp; While some dancers love to dance to techno tango
and expect to hear it at the milongas they attend, the traditionalists
express considerable disdain for the genre.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, the
controversy extends past the dance floor and onto the bandstand and into
the recording studio.&nbsp; According to an
<a href="http://www.letstango.com.ar/main/tecnotango.php#tecnotangoen" target="new">article
</a>that
originally appeared in the June 2004 issue of <a href="http://www.letstango.com.ar/" target="new">Let's
Tango</a> (a magazine from Buenos Aires), "Bandoneon player Rodolfo Mederos,
an innovator who played with Pugliese and Piazzolla, described techno tango
as 'a way of ignorance,' and considers it a wrong course for aesthetic
search.&nbsp; On the other hand, Adriana Varela and Ra&uacute;l Lavi&eacute;
approve of the trend and are even putting their voices among beats and
samplers."
<p>Some of the popular recordings that integrate tango and techno sounds

<p>In response to my query, Victor Levant sent me an email about the stretching
exercises he asked Bob Anderson to develop for tango dancers, "I began
from the point of view of a novice, who initially saw the tango stance
as a rigid one—undoubtedly a factor of my own instability on one leg or
the balls of my feet.&nbsp; I often found myself hurting after dancing
with my partners.&nbsp; And they too.&nbsp; Watching teachers and visitng
dancers, dancing with them in a class or a milonga, they felt like putty/spaghetti,
I couldn't lead them...they were so loose in their bodies.&nbsp; I began
to stretch my hamstrings and found that I was more at ease.&nbsp; So I
contacted Bob Anderson and discussed the notions of frame, disassociation,
static posture, knee injuries, lack or shortness of muscle around knee
caps,&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; And he kindly put together the exercises.&nbsp;
Some friends here in Montreal and I find them useful.&nbsp; I believe salsa
dancers would&nbsp; like them too."

a tango instructor from the San Francisco Bay Area, and <a href="http://www.dancevision.com/" target="new">Dance
Vision USA</a> have collaborated to create and disseminate a syllabus for
a standardized version of Argentine tango.&nbsp; Dance Vision USA is releasing
an extensive series of videos in support of the syllabus, and Christy is
teaching master classes for those who wish to become certified to teach
from the syllabus.
<p>Over the years, a number of different tango instructors with a background
in ballroom dancing have attempted to create syllabuses for a standardized
Argentine tango.&nbsp; None of these syllabuses has gained widespread acceptance
among Argentine tango dancers.&nbsp; Of course, no syllabus has been written
by an Argentine who is accepted as a master of the dance.&nbsp; Perhaps
more importantly, the process of standardization necessary to produce such
a syllabus loses the relationship, the individual expression, improvisation
and range of personal styles that are at the core of Argentine tango.&nbsp;&nbsp;
On <a href="http://www.tangonoticias.com/tangotalk/index.php" target="new">Tango
Talk</a> over at <a href="http://www.tangonoticias.com/" target="new">Tango
Noticias</a>, Pichi well expresses the general attitude that most good
Argentine tango dancers take toward a syllabus for a standardized Argentine
tango.&nbsp; She writes, "Don't we already have enough tango robots on
the dance floors?"
<p>Although we tango dancers tend to associate syllabuses with ballroom
dancing, Richard Powers distinguishes between authority-based dancing and
intelligent dancing in a manner that applies equally well to ballroom dancing
and Argentine tango.&nbsp; In his essay <a href="http://dance.stanford.edu/syllabi/intelligent.htm" target="new">Intelligent
Dancing</a>, Richard writes the following comments about authority-based
dancing, "Some studios would rather train their dancers to respond in only
one way to a given situation—the authorized 'correct' way.&nbsp; Steps
and patterns are predetermined by authorities so that the dancers have
very few decisions to make, if any. ... And the woman's role is doubly
automatic, not only following the trainer but also her male partner.&nbsp;
Personal variations away from his lead are considered mistakes and are
to be eliminated.&nbsp; Steps and styles outside the syllabus are 'incorrect.'"
<p>In contrast, Richard describes intelligent dancing as involving both
partners being spontaneously open to the infinite possibilities of the
moment, while responding to each other and the music.&nbsp; The flow of
the dance is a three-way communication between man, woman and music—with
each contributing something.

<p><a NAME="0040"></a><b><font size=+1>More on Dancing at Tango Festivals
(2)</font></b>
<br>25 May 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>In an email, Rose from Portland, Oregon offers some additional comments
about dancing at crowded milongas.
<p>I think it has less to do with level of dancing, beginning, intermediate,
hot shot etc... and more to do with how conscientious the leader is to
other dancers and the space around him.
<p>I have danced with plenty of beginners who have no problem navigating
because in crowded situations they know they do not have the skill to try
anything fancy so they just walk when they can and rock back and forth
when there's no room and never bump into anyone.
<p>The people who cause problems are usually either so absorbed in expressing
something in the music that they zoom about without regard to the disruption
they may be causing.&nbsp; Or they are concentrating so hard on the step
they are trying to execute that they don't realize when someone is behind
them or in front of them or whatever.&nbsp; In either case it is unlikely
they even realize they are causing a problem because they are not aware
of the space around them.
<p>When I find myself dancing with one of these leaders I tend to become
rather edgy, keep my eyes open and try to avoid taking steps that will
cause collisions or I take them smaller than led.
<p>In Portland, Robert Hauk does a very good job of teaching beginning
students pay attention to their partner, the music and the space around
them.&nbsp; In his Monday night class he stresses that taking care of his
partner is a leader's number one priority.&nbsp; Part of taking care of
her is not leading her to step into other people.

<p><a NAME="0039"></a><b><font size=+1>More on Dancing at Tango Festivals</font></b>
<br>25 May 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>In an email, Tom Stermitz of Denver offers some helpful hints for dancing
in the crowded conditions typical of festivals (and Buenos Aires).
<p>(1) Do not step backward. Do not do a back-step against line of dance.&nbsp;
Do not move in a direction you cannot see.&nbsp; If you learned the "8-Count
Basic with Dreaded Backstep"... un-learn it because it does NOT work on
a social dance floor.&nbsp; If the person in front of you suddenly steps
backward, put up your hand to keep them from smashing their heel onto your
partner's achilles tendon.
<p>(2) Memorized 12 and 8 step figures will not function.&nbsp; You have
two ways to approach improvisation.&nbsp; Learn to split the figure into
a different ending when you realize your first idea is leading to trouble
(this requires higher level tango skills). An easier strategy is to&nbsp;
utilize 4 and 2 count figures (elements).&nbsp; The rock-step is a good
defense against a potential collision.&nbsp; Drop all the hot moves you
just learned in class, but haven't quite mastered.&nbsp; Learn to do very
tight circular moves.
<p>(3) Social Tango in Buenos Aires is a dance around the perimeter of
the room.&nbsp; It is RECTANGULAR, rather than circular.&nbsp; (Performance
tango is the opposite, requiring you to fill the interior space of the
stage).&nbsp; Crowded conditions are best handled by setting up lanes.&nbsp;
The outer perimeter of the floor is the first lane.&nbsp; When that gets
too full, use the 2nd lane, and then the 3rd.&nbsp; The outer lane tends
to be safer, as you have potential collisions only from the inside.
<p>(4) In order to create a rectangular floor, dance ALL the way into the
corners, where you are protected on two sides, and maybe have a little
room for a fancier move.&nbsp; If you cut the corner, you have just eliminated
a space that would have fit in 2 or 3 more couples, then the next lane
knocks of a couple more... multiply times four corners, and you see this
has a lot of impact.
<p>(5) Entering a lane from the side, is like merging into traffic; don't
stop and meditate on your partner's lovely embrace while the lane stalls
behind you.&nbsp; If there is a gap in front of you it probably means a
pile up behind you. Take a few traveling steps to close the gap. When the
floor is moving nicely, everyone progresses slowly and steadily around
the room: a few steps forward, a couple rock-steps; a little turn to see
where the next gap is; safe in the corner, do a little figure; walk into
the new space; ocho cortado in place, etc
<p>(6) Dance very close to your partner; use smaller steps; don't whap
people with big-kicking boleos.&nbsp; While we no longer settle collisions
with a knife fight in the alley, bumping other people is not considered
to be good form.&nbsp; Don't zig-zag across the lanes.&nbsp; At some of
these festivals you see a few dancers zipping around really fast.&nbsp;
Avoiding collisions, they think they are pretty hot, ignoring the wake
of disruption they have created by all the near-misses.
<p>(7) Meeting people at big events can be daunting as many people already
have friends from multiple trips to Portland, Denver, Ann Arbor, Washington
DC, Buenos Aires, etc.&nbsp; The workshops are a great place to circulate
as all the teachers rotate partners.&nbsp; Invite your new friends out
to dinner, arrange to meet them later, and promise to see them again at

Day in Denver</a> or <a href="http://www.claysdancestudio.com/" target="new">October

<p>Over at <a href="http://www.dekay.org/dance/tango_comments/P440_0_2_0/" target="new">dekay.org</a>,
Daniel K&auml;smayr writes: "It is essential that teachers provide ideas,
concepts—not just steps and sequences.&nbsp; I know many students seem
to require steps, fancy steps, sequences.&nbsp; And it hurts to see them
waste their energy and time to master them.&nbsp; At the same time this
seems to be the most economic way for teachers to do so.&nbsp; (As a side
note: I believe the whole universe of partner dancing can easily fall into
this trap of steps/sequences vs. style/feeling/expression).&nbsp; Of course
the student is your customer and thus deserves attention—you cannot change
them, but you can give them bites of that 'more' that there is in tango.&nbsp;
I firmly believe that teachers always have the responsibility to get their
students on their own feet, give them the tools for createing their own
experience, also demand esponsibility for their own actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And I totally agree that a teacher who spends too much time telling about
the 'meta'-tango is wasting time—or wants to impress.&nbsp; A healthy balance
is needed."
<p>"If I look back at my tango life so far—the best teachers were not the
ones teaching me complicated steps—but they were teachers expressing style
in their own thoughts, movements.&nbsp; Of course it is always fun to master
a new step or fail miserably.&nbsp; But what really changes you is basic
technique like posture—and feeling, emotion, connection."
<p>Strangely enough, Daniel wrote his remarks in seeming disagreement with
my May 18 comments about what I see as the futility of trying too hard
at <a href="#0031">Teaching the Inner Essences of Tango</a>.&nbsp; I don't
see anywhere in my comments where I advocate teaching step patterns.&nbsp;
In fact, I am opposed to the idea of teaching or dancing tango as a collection
of step patterns.&nbsp; (I wonder if the teaching of step patterns is so
ubiquitous that it is presumed that someone who suggests that students
must find their own way through the door to the inner essences of tango
is justifying/advocating teaching step patterns.)
<p>What I am saying is the best teachers teach movement rather than spending
class time talking.&nbsp; I agree with Daniel that the best teachers lead
their students to the door of inner knowledge and inspire their students
to step through.&nbsp; In the end, however, those who would become tango
dancers must step through the door and find the knowledge in themselves.

<br><a NAME="0033"></a><b><font size=+1>Cliquishness at Milongas</font></b>
<br>19 May 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>One of the most common forms of seeming cliquishness that one can observe
at milongas is dancers sorting out by teachers.&nbsp; Those who have learned
from one local teacher may not dance much with the students of another
local teacher.&nbsp; Personally, I doubt that the participants have the
intention of creating exclusive cliques.&nbsp; This seeming cliquishness
more likely results because those who tend to dance together are more familiar
with each other and have compatible dance skills.
<p>Most people are more comfortable interacting with people they already
know.&nbsp; A gender imbalance compounds the issue because it is very difficult
for the men to leave the women who they know and have practiced with to
go dance with others.&nbsp; Most men owe a considerable debt to the women
who were their partners while they were learning to dance tango.
<p>For relatively new dancers, differences in styles and teaching methods
may also create incompatibilities.&nbsp; One teacher may teach milonguero,
another salon, another nuevo, and another fantasia.&nbsp; Some teachers
may emphasize lead and follow skills and improvisational techniques while
others teach memorized figures.

<p><a NAME="0031"></a><b><font size=+1>Teaching the Inner Essences of Tango</font></b>
<br>18 May 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>In recent years, I have begun to think that teachers can easily fall
into the trap of trying too hard to teach the inner essences of tango—such
as, connection, musicality or improvisation.&nbsp; A good pedagogy can
support the development of connection, musicality, improvisation and other
inner essences of tango, but the pedagogy only takes the students to the
door.&nbsp; The students must step through the door on their own if they
are to become dancers who fully understand and appreciate how these inner
essences contribute to tango.
<p>Good teachers can be inspiring, and good pedagogy can be extremely helpful
in pointing students in the right direction.&nbsp; You can talk about connection
and teach the mechanics of a good embrace, but the dancers have to find
connection in their own hearts and souls.&nbsp; You can suggest ways to
interpret the music and teach rhythmic tango movement, but the dancers
have to find musical expression in themselves&nbsp; You can explain that
tango is improvisational and teach basic tango movements and/or systems
for breaking down step patterns, but the dancers still have to improvise
on their own.
<p>When a teacher uses extensive class time trying to explain their own
understanding of an inner essence, they are likely to be wasting their
own efforts and their students' time.&nbsp; When it comes to movement,
knowledge cannot be poured in a student's ear.&nbsp; Dancers develop best
through their own experience of movement.

her feet are, where her momentum is heading, which steps flow smoothly
from her current step.&nbsp; He knows and cares what is comfortable for
her, what is pleasurable or fun.&nbsp; He dances for his partner's ability
and comfort.&nbsp; A good lead clearly suggests an option, which is different
from controlling her.&nbsp; He proposes, not prescribes, a certain way

(does not 'follow'), he refrains from exerting more power to press her

<p>Tango is an adventure people undertake because it seems so fun, passionate,
sexy and thrilling.&nbsp; And it is.&nbsp; But it also hides a secret gift.&nbsp;
To dance tango, you must learn to see yourself for all you are—the good
and the not so good—and be willing to dance it out in the world in the
arms of someone you may or may not know.&nbsp; When you dance tango beautifully,
you have learned to accept the person you are.&nbsp; When you dance, you
may never say a single word to your partner, but if you share that experience
with another person, and they share themselves with you, then you have
received the gift of tango.

is that it doesn't accurately describe the role.&nbsp; Women do not 'follow,'
they interpret signals they're given, with a keen responsiveness that is
not passive.&nbsp; The follow role is mentally and physically active, like
the flow state in sports.&nbsp; We admire the football player who zigzags
brilliantly through the field, completely aware of his surroundings and
responding instantly to each moment, rather than the one who uses brute
force to steamroller straight into the opponents, or the one who slavishly
follows a game plan which is no longer working.&nbsp; The nimble, intelligent
player, and the woman's role in dancing, are both the flow state of relaxed
responsiveness, paying highly active attention to possibilities."&nbsp;

<br>15 May 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>According to research by Wing Suen, biased views are likely to be self
perpetuating if information is costly (which it nearly always is).&nbsp;
When information is costly, individuals with biased views will give less
weight to information coming from people they know to frequently disagree
with themselves and more weight to people they know to frequently agree
with themselves.&nbsp; The more biased an individual's view is, the stronger
will be the contrary evidence necessary to change the view.&nbsp; Only
when a biased person receives contrary opinions from people who are thought
to be sufficiently like-minded will contrary opinions be given much weight.&nbsp;
Not surprisingly, biased views can lead to increased polarization between
different groups of people—as the population pulls into self-reinforcing
groups that tend to exclude outside opinion.&nbsp; (From the April 2004

<p>There is a folk song that says, "When you go through life, make this
your goal; watch the donut, not the hole."&nbsp; For me, watching for my
mistakes or my partner's mistakes is watching the hole.
<p>Personally, I found that some absolutely wonderful tango experiences
seduced me into seeking perfection, which led me to blame myself and my
partners (often without their knowledge) for "mistakes" that kept the dance
short of perfection.&nbsp; I have recognized my perfectionist ways and
am somewhat reformed.&nbsp; My own belief is that we cannot find heaven
when we are seeking perfection.
<p>Classes and practicas are the time to focus on refining technique and
building knowledge.&nbsp; But even in such activities, I have found through

it is leads to more trouble than most of us really like.

I doubt that the opportunity to masquerade as an idealized man or woman
is why tango speaks to people all over the world today.&nbsp; Argentine
tango is not an opportunity to wallow in nostalgia for an idealized era
that never quite existed—when men were ideally masculine and women were
ideally feminine
<p>I doubt many of today's tango dancers would have put much effort to
develop their skills in a dance that is archaic or expresses an archaic

<br>13 May 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>Developing ease in dancing tango is largely a matter of practice.&nbsp;
In fact, practice is the most essential ingredient in learning to dance
tango—so much so that I find it better to think of instruction as only
providing guidance about how to dance.&nbsp; Through practice, dancers
find tango in their own bodies, and in doing so get away from the internal
voices of criticism.
<p>Some instructors take the approach of attempting to clone students in
their own particular way of dancing tango.&nbsp; In taking this approach,
an instructor typically supplies an external voice of criticism that works
in conjunction with the student's internal voice and keeps the student
away from ease.&nbsp; Strangely enough the combination of internal and
external criticism frequently drives the insecure student into more classes
and workshops—during which the instructors offer more detailed instruction
on dancing like themselves.&nbsp; Frequently, such students fail to practice
because practice does not offer the instructor's direction.&nbsp; Yet,
the lack of ease drives the student into more classes and workshops.&nbsp;
The consequence is a spiral away from ease.&nbsp; Practice reverses the
spiral, and takes the dancer toward ease.

<p>I think are at least two musical divides in dancing tango.&nbsp; There
is the well-recognized divide between those who dance to the rhythm of
the music and those who do not.&nbsp; Among those who dance to the rhythm
of the music, there is another divide between those who dance doggedly
to the beat and those who are interpreting other rhythmic elements in the
music as well as dancing to the beat.
<p>The latter group can be thought of as being in the third category of
musicality.&nbsp; Dancers in the third category exemplify the idea that
it is not necessary to dance tango only to the beat.&nbsp; In order to
reach the third category with any degree of musicality, however, a dancer
must first learn to dance to the beat.&nbsp; Unfortunately, some dancers
who have not yet connected with the music confuse entrance into the third
category with disregarding the beat.

the follower on the beat, we immediately come up against a couple of big
challenges.&nbsp; First, the leader can indicate when it is time for the
follower to begin her step, but he has little control of when she finishes
it.&nbsp; Second, on some turns—those where he is pivoting on his axis—the
leader has very little control of when the follower may begin one of her
steps.&nbsp; Consequently, I am inclined to regard keeping the beat as
a collaborative effort.&nbsp; It is actually the job of the follower to
step on the beat herself, and it is the job of the leader to facilitiate
her efforts by marking her step at the proper moment.&nbsp; Leading the
follower to be on the beat requires that the leader give the follower enough
advance notice about what the next step will be and what, if any, the changes
in timing might be.

<br>13 May 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>The English language originated with the Norman conquest of England.&nbsp;
The combination of the German dialect spoken in Anglia and the French spoken
by the Normans became a pidgin language spoken in England.&nbsp; Eventually
the English forced their language on other people in the British Isles—including
the Scots, Welsh and Irish.&nbsp; Despite its disreputable origins, English
eventually became a world language.
<p>During the era when England was the dominant world power, however, French,
German and Spanish had more cachet as international languages.&nbsp; The
internationalization of English owes to the open architecture that Americans
introduced into their English.&nbsp; With open architecture, anyone can
introduce new words.&nbsp; The Japanese created the term "WalkMan."&nbsp;
In contrast with French, which has an academy that jealously guards what
can be considered French, anything can come into usage in the internationalized
American English as long as it is accepted by users.&nbsp; Consequently,
"American" English gained dominance with globalization. This story is similar
to the domination of the PC over Apple computers.&nbsp; Open architecture
creates a product to which more people can contribute and more people can
use.
<p>Open and closed architecture are likely to have similar effects in social
dancing.&nbsp; Syllabus-restrained forms of dancing will lose their vitality
over time, eventually becoming vintage dances to be reconstructed by a
future dance professor.&nbsp; Dances that are open to evolution will remain
vital, even if they are complex.
<p>Argentine tango has open architecture and continues to evolve.&nbsp;
People can combine elements from styles that were considered completely
separate 10 years ago and find acceptance.&nbsp; People can introduce new
ways of dancing or looking at the dance—as the nuevo-style dancers have
done—and those innnovations have a chance of being accepted into the dance.&nbsp;
Of course, someone can say, "Argentine tango isn't what it used to be,"&nbsp;
but such comments are a sign of vitality and not likely to be of much concern
to those who are busy dancing tango and expressing themselves.
<p>As Richard Powers says, "As a dance historian, I have seen, over and
over again, a dance form dies out when it became too rigidly standardized.&nbsp;
The dances that thrive over time are the ones that keep evolving to incorporate
aspects from current culture.&nbsp; The tango underwent great changes in
Buenos Aires during the 20th century because it was a healthy, living,
evolving form.&nbsp; Even though some groups want to kill this evolutionary
process with their insistence that dancers conform to their one 'correct'
style, there are enough enlightened groups out there to keep the tango
alive and thriving."&nbsp; (See Jackie Wong's <a href="http://www.tangopulse.net/" target="new">interview

<br>13 May 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>Recently when I was playing several pieces of music that I haven't really
mastered on my guitar, I realized that if I put too much effort into the
mechanics of my playing it took away from the feeling of my playing, but
if I didn't put enough effort into the mechanics of my playing, the music
deteriorated from a lack of execution.&nbsp; What I recognized for myself
is that mastery comes from developing a big difference between too much
and too little attention to the mechanics, so that I am not sitting on
the knife edge between two different types of failure.&nbsp; In playing
the guitar, mastery comes from practicing enough to develop what pianists
often call "touch."&nbsp; I think this idea of developing touch carries
over to improving tango dance skills.&nbsp; If we use practice to refine
our mechanics, we can build our dance skills to the point where there is
a big difference between too much and too little attention to the mechanics.

<p><a NAME="0013"></a><b><font size=+1>A Tender Embrace</font></b>
<br>13 May 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>Many people who dance tango use a firm frame, and many instructors teach
a firm frame.&nbsp; In my experience, however, I find that a firm frame
is neither necessary nor desirable for dancing tango.&nbsp; Open or close,
I always prefer a soft embrace (and no leading with the arms).
<p>In saying that I prefer a softer embrace, I mean that I want the embrace
to have enough softness in it to provide some flexibility for movement.&nbsp;
At the same time I would prefer to feel the energy of my partner in the
embrace.&nbsp; If we are in an open position, a little bit of energy in
our arms is helpful because our chests are less able to transmit and receive
the all of the energy we may choose to express, but our chests remain the
primary conduits for the energy.
<p>I would not deny the authenticity of firm or rigid embraces.&nbsp; Some
of the best known stage dancers use relatively strong embraces, as do many
social dancers in Buenos Aires.&nbsp; I am just saying that I prefer a
softer, tender embrace.&nbsp; I will say, however, no woman has ever asked
me to make my embrace firmer and that has been many years since any woman
has told me that my lead was unclear.&nbsp; At the same time, the women
with whom I most enjoy dancing give me the impression that our embrace
is shared and voluntary—neither stiff and open like we can never really
touch each other, nor clamped on tight to the point where we do not have
our own spaces.
<p>Using a softer (not limp) embrace, the lead originates in the movements
of the torso/chest.&nbsp; In some cases, the lead can be further transmitted
by the movements of the arms and hands that go along with the torso/chest
movement, but when dancing with an experienced woman, the arms and hands
accompany the movement.&nbsp; They are not necessary to initiate her movements
in any way.&nbsp; In fact, it is completely possible to lead and follow
movements in an embrace that is open and in which neither partner is touching
each other.
<p>I once heard a woman describe her experience dancing with Pablo Veron.&nbsp;
She said that she never felt the lead and that he had willed her movements
rather than led them.&nbsp; To me, she described a perfect connection.&nbsp;
The sound of her voice and the look in her eyes gave me the same impression.

<br>12 May 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>I used to think of both partners dancing with relatively firm arms and
separate axes in an open embrace.&nbsp; I thought of the arms softening
as the embrace became closer and the frame moved into the woman.&nbsp;
It was really the nuevo dancers/instructors—particularly Fabian Salas—who
opened my eyes about the idea of using softer arms in an open embrace.&nbsp;
The nuevo dancers softened their arms to create more possibilities for
movement.&nbsp; Imagine trying to do an overturn ocho in a somewhat open
embrace while keeping the arms rigid and not leading with the arms.&nbsp;
It may be possible, but it certainly doesn't feel that good.&nbsp; So,
softer arms may be a more modern approach to dancing tango in an open embrace.
<p>Once I discovered that a nearly rigid embrace wasn't really necessary,
I was no longer interested in using it for any style of tango dancing.&nbsp;
Interestingly enough, I found that a softer embrace makes shifting between
dancing in an open and close embrace much easier.&nbsp; It also allows
the woman greater flexibility in initiating her own, unled movements.

<p><a NAME="0011"></a><b><font size=+1>Intensifying the Experience of Tango</font></b>
<br>11 May 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>Argetine tango has at least two basic elements.&nbsp; One is the relationship
between a man and a woman.&nbsp; The other is the expression of creativity
in movement.&nbsp; All styles of Argentine tango are a mixture of these
two elements—and probably other elements.
<p>Fantasia tango places a greater emphasis on the visual expression of
creativity in movement, but in remaining tango, fantasia at least acknowledges
the relationship between a man and a woman.&nbsp; A recent modern dance
performance that I saw reminded me how androgynous creative movement can
be.&nbsp; In comparison, fantasia is about a relationship between a man
and a woman—even if it is a stylized representation.&nbsp; Of course, for
memorized routines, the creativity of movement is in the original choreography.
<p>Milonguero-style tango places a strong emphasis on the relationship
between a man and a woman, as does the culture of tango, but in remaining
tango, milonguero-style tango still has a relatively large vocabulary for
creative movement.&nbsp; An embrace without movement is enough to express
the relationship between a man and a woman.
<p>The nuevo approach to tango is to increase the understanding of the
vocabulary for creative movement and self expression.&nbsp; As we might
expect, some critics of the approach are concerned about the possibility
that the nuevo approach dilutes the relationship aspects of tango.
<p>What about dancing memorized figures in an open embrace?&nbsp; Although
that is how many people start in Argentine tango, such an approach is more
like a memory of tango.&nbsp; The use of memorized figures transfers the
creativity to the person who originated the figures, and the distant embrace
can dilute the relationship between the man and woman.&nbsp; Intensifying
the experience of Argentine tango comes through developing improvisational
skills and in closing the embrace.

<p><a NAME="0010"></a><b><font size=+1>Why Golden Age Music Still Dominates
Milongas</font></b>
<br>5 May 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>Salsa and swing dancers use many contemporary recordings, but tango
dancers mostly dance to recordings from the golden age of tango (mid-1930s
through early 1950s).&nbsp; This phenomenon doesn't mean that tango dancers
are living in the past.&nbsp; Rather, it owes to the separate evolution
of&nbsp; tango music and its social dance form after the golden age ended.
<p>For the first half of the 20th century, Argentine tango music and social
dancing evolved together.&nbsp; The ways of moving the body and the feet
in Argentine tango were expressions of the music.&nbsp; From the mid-1950s
through the mid-1980s, however, Argentine tango music and social dancing
evolved independently of each other.
<p>In the early 1950s, the Argentine government repressed tango dancing
by limiting public gatherings and cracking down on the milonguero lifestyle.&nbsp;
As a result, tango dancing was pushed into small neighborhood clubs and
private homes where it did not evolve much, and recordings from the golden
age continued to be played.&nbsp; No longer playing for large dance parties,
the tango orchestras shifted toward a concert sound.&nbsp; Astor Piazzolla,
who was the leading exponent of the new tango sound, kept tango music alive
and evolving, but he was not particularly concerned about playing for seemingly
invisible social dancers.
<p>By the time the show <i>Tango Argentino</i> renewed public interest
in tango in the mid-1980s, the contemporary tango music of the time was
no longer connected to the social dance form of tango.&nbsp; Stage dancers
were quite happy to use Piazzolla's music and other progressive tango arrangments
for their performances, but the newer music lacked the rhythmic qualities
that were preferred by social dancers.&nbsp; As people flocked to dance
tango socially, they rediscovered the older recordings that were still
in use by those who had been dancing tango in clubs and at home.&nbsp;
The recording companies accommodated the renewed interest in tango by reissuing
many of the classics on CD.&nbsp; Consequently, music from the golden age
still dominates milongas—some 50-70 years after it was recorded.
<p>New recordings are emerging, however.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few modern orchestras,
such as Color Tango and El Arranque, have begun playing music with a golden-age
dance beat and somewhat more progressive arrangements.&nbsp; In a way,
the evolution of music for social dancing is picking up where it left off.&nbsp;
The body of such recordings is relatively small, however, and the sound
pallette offered by these recordings is similar to what was recorded toward
the end of the golden age.
<p>In a somewhat different vein, tango-fusion music has appeared recently.&nbsp;
Tango-fusion integerates traditional tango rhythms and instrumentation
with other musical traditions, contemporary instruments and electronica
to create a modern and culturally relevant world tango music with a dance-club
sound.&nbsp; This music too offers a relatively narrow sound pallette,
and one that can be quite monotonous if overused.
<p>If the tango dancing remains sufficiently popular to support new recordings,
the music may continue to evolve, and gradually some of the golden-age
recordings will be supplanted by newer material.&nbsp; Music has timeless
qualities, however, and many of the recordings from the golden age will
prove just too good to take off playlists.

<p><a NAME="0008"></a><b><font size=+1>Approaches to Teaching and Learning
Tango</font></b>
<br>30 April 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>Although we may aspire to dance Argentine tango socially, I think it
is inevitable that most of us are going to learn much of our Argentine
tango by taking formal lessons.&nbsp; Somehow through the process of that
instruction and sometimes by overcoming it, we have to find our way to
navigating and developing our own styles for dancing tango socially.
<p>I think there are three major approaches to teaching tango:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Memorized patterns;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) The Structural Approach;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Small Elements.
<p>Though styles of dancing and the approaches to teaching tango need not
be linked, each of these approaches to dancing has become associated with
a style of dancing.&nbsp; Memorized patterns are often taught by instructors
who have a stage background, teach "salon-style" tango and rely on the
eight-count basic.&nbsp; The structural approach is typically taught by
instructors associated with nuevo tango.&nbsp; Teaching tango as small
elements is primarily associated with milonguero-style instructors.
<p>I think the evidence shows that a person can find their way to improvisation,
good social dancing skills and their own style through any of these three
approaches to teaching.&nbsp; The real questions are which methods of instruction
work best for most individuals; how well can the students dance before
they reach their own tango; and how many dancers will be encouraged to
go on to find their own tango?
<p><b>Memorized Patterns:</b> Learning tango as memorized patterns produces
dancers who cannot navigate until they break free of their patterns.&nbsp;
Dancing memorized patterns also can inhibit the development of rhyhmic
skills.&nbsp; It is also likely to be a route in which many people never
find their own tango, though some obviously make it.
<p><b>Structural Approach:</b> The structural approach organizes the many
elements of tango, but it often leaves people to find those elements on
their own.&nbsp; As such, the structural approach may work best for dancers
who already know a signficant amount of tango and who have an analytical
mind for learning and an intuitive mind for dancing.&nbsp; The structural
approach may overwhelm and discourage those with limited tango experience
bcecause it gives them a huge amount of material to digest at once.&nbsp;
Working to develop a mastery of the structure can also delay the development
of rhythmic skills.
<p><b>Small Elements:</b> Learning to dance in small elements has the great
advantage of maintaining natural navigational skills from the beginning.&nbsp;
The small elements also allow the dancers to concentrate on developing
their rhythmic skills. In both these ways, teaching in small elements probably
does the most to encourage dancers to stay with tango.&nbsp; The downside
is that because dancers can reach mediocre acceptability with relatively
little work, they may remain shallow in their dance skills and may not
care if they are having a good time.
<p>My experience learning, teaching and observing how others dance and
learn makes me hesitant to offer a one-fits-all formula for teaching, but
I lean toward thinking that small elements ought to be emphasized in most
beginning through intermediate classes; structure should be taught gradually
as dancers develop a knowledge of tango in their bodies; and teaching memorized
patterns is best reserved for dancers who are capable of disassembling
those patterns and making them their own.

<p><a NAME="0006"></a><b><font size=+1>Rhuummmp and Ric Tic</font></b>
<br>23 April 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>Argentine tango music and the dance evolved together.&nbsp; That's why
the ways of moving the body and the feet in Argentine tango are inseperable
from the music itself.&nbsp; Move with the qualities expressed in Argentine
tango music, and you can step, rock, wiggle or shake in any direction you
want and you will still be expressing Argentine tango.&nbsp; Move in Argentine
tango steps without the qualities expressed in Argentine tango music, and
you will not be expressing Argentine tango.&nbsp; For these reasons, dancing
other steps to Argentine tango music better expresses the qualities of
Argentine tango than dancing Argentine tango steps to other music.
<p>Such a conclusion may lead one to ask, "What are the qualities of movement
that express Argentine tango?"
<p>For tango music with a slow, powerful rhythm like that played by Di
Sarli or Pugliese, the man's step forward involves surging with the body,
without lunging or bouncing; accelerating through the half beat and then
slowing to a stop on the beat, with the hips sinking slightly as the foot
lands.&nbsp; This movement is best accomplished by keeping the knees soft,
the hips soft and over the feet, the body over the hips, and heavily caressing
the floor with the feet while moving with a rhuummmp, rhuummmp, rhuummmp,
rhuummmp.
<p>For tango music with the prominent double-time (or ric-tic) rhythms
like that played by D'Arienzo, the appropriate movement is better be expressed
as a combination of slow rhuummmp and quicker, ric-tic movements, in a
pattern such as rhuummmp, rhuummmp, ric tic, rhuummmp.&nbsp; When expressing
the ric-tic elements of the music, the hips and feet take a lighter quality.&nbsp;
For the slower rhuummmp movements, however, the hips sink and the feet
heavily caress the floor in the same manner used for dancing to the slower
music.

<p><a NAME="0005"></a><b><font size=+1>Dancing Tango in Tight Spaces</font></b>
<br>13 April 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>Often the discussion about navigation and dance floor etiquette makes
it all sound like a bunch of restrictive rules and nothing more.&nbsp;
In fact, dance-floor etiquette is nothing more than common-sense guidelines
so that everyone can share a crowded dance floor.&nbsp; The main reason
we want to share the floor is that doing so is part of the fun of dancing.&nbsp;
Some of my most favorite times dancing have been on very crowded floors—when
dancing became an interaction with the couples around me and my partner.
<p>In tight spaces, followers contribute to safety and courtesy by making
sure they are keeping their feet under themselves, their boleos on the
floor, and not taking too much space and time for embellishments.&nbsp;
Leaders are responsible for sharing the space with other couples on the
dance floor and contribute to safety and courtesy through their interraction
with the other couples.&nbsp; When I see the couple ahead of me doing something
that needs a little space, I give it to them.&nbsp; Later, I may get the
same courtesy.
<p>The growth of tango means more crowded dance venues and raises the demands
for navigational skills.&nbsp; Many of the big tango festivals around the
country already have crowded floors, and many people aren't dancing very
well in crowds, which generates minor injuries and continued discussion
about the problem.&nbsp; If we work at developing our navigational skills,
there is a big reward when we all get together.&nbsp; We will all be able
to share the dance floor and maybe 30-300 of us can experience tango heaven
together.
<p>We will always have those times of the night when there is more room
and we can open up our movements.&nbsp; It would be nice though if it was
possible for people to dance well on a crowded floor when we all find ourselves
together in the same room.&nbsp; (Based on <a href="http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2004/msg00304.html" target="new">Teaching

<br>12 April 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>Doesn't a form of partitioning occur in most communities?&nbsp; Don't
people mostly attend the milongas that better fit their own tastes?&nbsp;
It's the big tango events that have the potential to draw dancers with
diverse interests—particulary if the event has a diverse mix of instructors.&nbsp;
Maybe for a big enough tango event with diverse instructors, simultaneous
milongas might better serve differing tastes.
<p>One of the attractions of a well attended milonga is that everyone enjoys
the shared experience.&nbsp; Breaking a moderately attended milonga into
three smaller events isn't likely to be as much fun.
<p>Instead of three separate milongas, what about three djs broadcasting
on three channels to people wearing headsets?&nbsp; One channel might feature
highly rhythmic music from the golden era.&nbsp; Another channel might
feature a blend of smoother to dramatic music from the golden and later
eras.&nbsp; The third channel might feature a blend of theatrical and modern
neo-tango music.
<p>Asking someone to dance might be a bit more complicated because the
couple would have to agree to which channel they should listen while dancing.&nbsp;
Suppose, however, that my partner and I agreed to listen to different music
while dancing together—me to the rhythmic channel playing D'Arienzo's "El
Flete" and my partner to another channel playing Pugliese's "La Bordona."&nbsp;
You can imagine the difficulty in us dancing together.&nbsp; We would quickly
recognize that the music provides a coordinating glue to our dancing.
<p>To some extent the same problem would arise if each partner in a couple
was listening to the same music, but the couples on the floor had selected
different music.&nbsp; The music provides the coordination across couples
that is necessary for navigation.
<p>Participating in an activity that requires coordination across individuals,
such as dancing at a milonga, requires at least some degree of agreement
(and compromise) between those individuals.&nbsp; We all make some compromise
in our personal tastes to participate in a shared activity such as dancing
at a milonga.

<p><a NAME="0003"></a><b><font size=+1>The Sweet Zone of Tango Rhapsody</font></b>
<br>11 April 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>Sometimes "Tango Rapture" seems to be used as a cover for ungracious
floor craft.&nbsp; With their movements, some dancers seem to be saying
"Look out for (or <b>AT</b>) ME, I'm in tango heaven!"&nbsp; Mmm...&nbsp;
Riiiiight...&nbsp; The generosity these dancers exploit is not infinite.&nbsp;
Putting first things first, dancing at a milonga is a group experience.&nbsp;
The sweet zone of tango rhapsody is for those leaders who don't cause trouble
by disrupting the flow of other dancers and who can work with the same
amount space as everybody else to maintain the flow.&nbsp; (Based on <a href="http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2004/msg00610.html" target="new">Rhapsodic

<p><a NAME="0002"></a><b><font size=+1>Nostalgia for the Bohemian Ideal</font></b>
<br>6 April 2004 — Stephen Brown
<p>Sometimes I look back with nostalgia to when Susan and I were first
learning to dance Argentine tango in the SF Bay Area in the mid-1990s.&nbsp;
At that time in the SF Bay Area, Argentine tango somehow represented the
Bohemian ideal of freedom, beauty, truth and love.&nbsp; It was a warm
and friendly atmosphere.&nbsp; None of us knew much about different styles
of dancing; we were struggling to learn; and yet somehow we found something
in the music and dance of Argentine tango that reached deeply into our
hearts and souls.
<p>Since then, ..., the world has erupted in variations, authenticity debates,
and distinctions between social and show dancing...&nbsp; It is a little
hard to face the loss of naivete, but also the distinctions in styles that
gradually grew into dogmatic and polarizing viewpoints.&nbsp; We all gradually
forgot or never knew that Anibal Troilo said that there is no such thing
as old and new tango, only tango well danced and poorly danced.
<p>Like many others, I participated in the polarization—maybe not in San
Francisco, where Susan and I were simply visitors—but in my own community
and on various electronic forums.&nbsp; I don't think that many of us deliberately
acted to create polarization.&nbsp; I was sure that I knew the truth because
I experienced it in the tango music I heard and in the tango I danced.&nbsp;
Well, maybe I knew the truth because I needed to believe that I knew the
truth.
<p>The trouble is that many of us who expressed the truth we found in Argentine
tango denied what we saw as half-truths, distortions and lies that others
found in it and created dogmatic approaches to tango.
<p>As Argentine tango has grown throughout the world and we dancers have
gradually matured into their own styles, the excitement of participating
in something new has worn off.&nbsp; In many communities, the polarization
and clashes about styles have emerged and continued...&nbsp; Those who
dance nuevo won't dance with those who dance milonguero, who won't dance
those who dance salon, who won't dance with those who dance fantasia.&nbsp;
Maybe the styles aren't completely compatible, but the feelings of separation
and animosity are much deeper.
<p>What I am beginning to realize is that tango reveals our own truth to
each of us, but it keeps secret from us the truths that it reveals to others.&nbsp;
Making an effort to reach across the lines of polarization and separation
is important if we are to experience more than our own ideas of truth,
freedom and beauty and find the love and connection that is Argentine tango.

When it does, it gives you a glimpse but it remains, as it has forever,
surrounded by a halo of impregnable mystery."&nbsp; Anibal Troilo
