<p><a NAME="teaching"></a><b>About Florencia's Teaching:</b> Florencia
brings a wealth of experience as a tango performer, social dancer and teacher,
as well as extensive work as a contemporary dance performer to her teaching
of Argentine Tango.&nbsp; This experience makes her teaching clear and
consistent.
<p>Her teaching covers a wide range of social styles including salon-style
tango, traditional and new vocabulary, milonguero-style tango, milonga,
milonga traspie and tango waltz. She has a special talent for teaching
great technique, embellishments and musicality to both followers and leaders.&nbsp;
She teaches the building blocks of the tango and reveals conceptual frameworks
and techniques that allow dancers to learn to create their own steps and
decorations, as well as to dance with grace and musicality.
<p>Florencia works to develop the subtle communication between partners
because she has found in her own experience that this is the communication
that takes the dance to a magical and unforgettable level.&nbsp; The communication
is found through a dynamic interpretation of the both the follower's and
leader's roles in which both partners find space to be active and passive,
and is furthered when both partners develop their own sensuality and grace
of movement.
<p>Followers find the active aspects of their role by learning the spaces
in the dance where they are able to contribute their own interpretation
and expression.&nbsp; Followers develop this ability by learning how to
be in charge of their own movement while listening and responding to their
partners.&nbsp; In starting with a clear mind and open body, followers
are able to respond more sensitively to the games proposed by their partners
and are able to propose their own.
<p>Leaders find sensuality by offering an embrace to the followers that
lets them enjoy the dance from the beginning.&nbsp; They develop clarity
in their leading by learning how to express maximum intent with a minimum
of movement—expressing the intent with a soft touch before the follower's
action, rather than forcing the movements.&nbsp; Leaders also grow in the
dance through the quality of their own movement and by offering an invitation
to a dance journey that is interesting musically and is expressed from
the heart, rather than through an intent to impress.&nbsp; Developing the
ability to communicate with the followers requires experimentation and
a listening from the heart to discover what pleases and enthralls each
follower.

<h2>
<a NAME="private"></a>Florencia's Private Lessons:</h2>

The space for a private lesson is the space to share with your teacher
all your intimate questions about the dance, to express all your concerns
about everything that is needed to be taken care of inside a safe
environment and contained by the compassionate and helpful vision of the
teacher.

<p>You may be concern about technique, execution of certain steps,
miscommunication with a partner, musicality, style, or anything that you
feel are places where you would like to spend more time and experience
more intensively than what you do in a group class.

<p>A private lesson can be about any topic where you notice yourself weaker
or not secure enough in your dance and you need to clear doubts.&nbsp; It is
very common in the process of learning tango that people get confused and
frustrated, and find the feedback from the practice partner is no longer
helpful.

<p>It is in moments like these when the teacher's advice can be very soothing and
supportive.

<p>The background of the teacher is important, of course, but more important is
the teacher's talent to see what the student needs the most at each particular
moment.&nbsp; Those needs are always different with each student.&nbsp; There
is no formula that works for everybody.&nbsp; A teacher with enough experience
may be able to unlock places where we all get stock when we are learning something
very new an different for our bodies and souls.

<p>It is also necessary to help with the cultural breakthrough that happens with
everybody who decides to go deeper to learn this dance and many other disciplines
too.&nbsp; It is important to welcome that moment and to breathe the transitions
so you can allow transformation to happen.

<p>In Florencia's case, she uses a number of of precious tools that she learned through
her life as a dancer and a personal researcher that helped her expand her consciousness
about tango and herself.&nbsp; Her experience includes many years of tango, ballet,
modern dance, dance anatomy, Laban/Bartenieff movement analysis, eutonia, Iyengar Yoga,
Zen and chanting meditation.&nbsp; She also has to thank many years of body pain and
cancer experience that guided her to the new self she is today. 

<p>Florencia's fee for a private lesson in the United States is $100 for an hour plus
the studio fee.&nbsp;

<p>A partner is preferable for private lessons.&nbsp; Florencia also offers semi-private
lessons for groups that organize themselves.

<p>To schedule private lessons in your area, please contact your local organizer or

<a NAME="video"></a>Florencia's Instructional Video</h2>
<b>Florencia Taccetti — <i>Technique and Adornment for Followers</i></b>
<br>In this highly-rated video, Florencia covers good posture and balance
for dancing, as well as techniques for ochos, turns, boleos, amagues, ganchos
and adornments.&nbsp; Among the adornments that Florencia examines are
those used with walking steps, ochos, turns, sandwiches and calesitas.&nbsp;
She also covers ochos, turns and adornments in close-embrace style tango,
as well as the use of adornments in milonga and vals.&nbsp; In teaching
adornments, Florencia demonstrates many of her own adornments, but in keeping
with her teaching philosophy, she emphasizes technique over specific adornments,
encouraging students to develop their own adornments.&nbsp; While teaching,
Florencia is always careful to present the proper angle in this one-camera
production.&nbsp; In addition to the numerous demonstrations of instructional
elements to music, the video includes five demonstration dances showing
Florencia’s technique—four with Julio Mendez serving as her partner and
one with Daniel Trenner.&nbsp; On the video, Florencia teaches in Spanish,
and Brooke Burdett provides English translation.&nbsp; Produced by Daniel
Trenner for Bridge to the Tango.&nbsp; For more information about the video,
