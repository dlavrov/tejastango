<p>Tango began originally as a dance, with sensual choreographies and very
simple music. It came from the lowest social classes, and in the beginning
it was only danced by men. As the choreography and lyrics started to change,
tango began to spread to all the other social classes.
<p>The first tango orchestras were trios, usually with a harp, flute and
violin.&nbsp; Sometimes a trio might substitute or expand to include other
instruments such as a bandoneon, a concertina, a mandolin, or a harmonica.
The musicians played intuitively without formal academic training.&nbsp;
Tangos were frequently improvised from very simple tunes.&nbsp; The players
had rudimentary technique, and the lyrics were superficial.
<p>In time, the guitar (brought to Argentina by the Spanish) replaced the
harp and was used to give rhythm to the tango. The dance drew on the "bordoneos"
(strummed rhythms) from the guitar, "fiorituras" (flowery embellishments)
from the flute, and the "pizzicatos" (staccato plucked notes) from the
violin.&nbsp; With these elements, tango had what was regarded as naughty
sound, which invited the dancers to be sensual.
<p>Among the recorded dance venues were Tambito, El Vel&oacute;dromo, El
Kioskito and Lo de Hansen.&nbsp; The regulars at these venues were the
"compadritos" (street ruffians) and members of the porte&ntilde;o (Buenos
Aires) aristocracy.
<p>The piano was long used as a solo instrument in "peringundines" (brothels)
and dance houses.&nbsp; The instrument didn't have a place in early tango
trios because its substantial weight made it difficult to move from place
to place.
<p>The piano introduced tango to the highest social classes, but it was
Roberto Firpo who introduced the piano into tango orchestras.&nbsp; A trio
formed by Roberto Firpo (piano), Alcides Palavecino (violin) and Juan Carlos&nbsp;
Bazan (clarinet) created a radical change in tango instrumentation when
it substituted piano for guitar.&nbsp; Peforming at El Vel&oacute;dromo
and later at El Tambito the trio initiated the era of "piano criollo tangos."
Other great pianists of the era include Pancho Nicolini, Camil&iacute;n,
Araujo, Manuel Campoamor, Bevilacqua and Rosendo Mendiz&aacute;bal.
<p>The early tangos began to be written down, and that encouraged their
widespread dissemination.&nbsp; Among the oldest written tangos are "El
Esquinazo," "El Porte&ntilde;ito," "El Choclo," and "Yunta Brava" by&nbsp;
Angel Villoldo; "La Cara de la Luna" by Manuel Campoamor; "Z Club" and
"El Entrerriano" by Rosendo Mendiz&aacute;bal; "Uni&oacute;n C&iacute;vica"
by Santa Cruz; "Don Juan" by Ernesto Ponzio; and "La Morocha" and "Felicia"
by Enrique Saborido.
<p>Over time, the bandoneon (which has become the most characteristic instrument
of the tango) supplanted the flute.&nbsp; For a while, the flute and bandoneon
stood side by side, but gradually the flute disappeared.&nbsp; The change
in instrumentation brought another radical change to tango, giving it a
more sentimental and less flowery style.&nbsp; Among the great early bandoneonists
were Arturo Berstein, Vicente Greco, Juan Maglio Pacho, Augusto Pedro Berto,
Genaro Exp&oacute;sito and Eduardo Arolas.
<p>Once the bandoneon had replaced the flute and the piano had replaced
the guitar, the basis for the orquesta tipica (typical orchestra) was established.&nbsp;
Among the great pianists in these early orquestas tipicas were Agust&iacute;n
Bardi, Enrique Saborido and Jos&eacute; Mart&iacute;nez. Many guitarists,
such as Domingo Greco, Samuel Castriota, Luciano R&iacute;os and Luis Bertein
switched to piano or continued to play both guitar and piano.
<p>The limited technical skills of the early musicians prevented a meaningful
diversity of styles and interpretations.&nbsp; As the tango and its players
advanced, the primitive rhythmic division of 2x4 beat gave way to the more
sophisticated 4x8 beat.&nbsp; Shaped by the bandoneon, the music slowed
in tempo and became smoother.&nbsp; The lyrics began to tell a story.
<p>The composers—such as Firpo, Carlos Posadas, Arturo De Bassi, Eduardo
Arolas, Vicente Greco, Agust&iacute;n Bardi and Francisco Canaro—began
to create tangos more suitable for dancing.&nbsp; Differences could be
found in the compositions, but the playing remained similar.&nbsp; Differences
in style did not appear until years later.
