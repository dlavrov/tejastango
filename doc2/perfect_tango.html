by Stephen Brown
<p>I must confess that I have been seduced by the magic of a perfect tango
(or was it a vals?).&nbsp; The music and my partner resonated in my heart
and soul, and mine in hers, as we moved effortlessly around the room.&nbsp;
The floor was crowded, but it was just us two and the music, though we
were aware of others just enough to avoid collisions.&nbsp; For one sublime
tango, we touched each others' hearts in ways that words cannot match.&nbsp;
The feeling was unexpected; it was a golden paradise, the promise of heaven.&nbsp;
Then the music ended, our eternity of three minutes was over, and we returned
as strangers to our own tables.
<p>Since then, too often have I searched for the promise of a perfect tango.&nbsp;
Too hard have I worked on perfecting my craft, at pushing my partner to
work with me to perfect her craft, at understanding the music, at deciding
what music is best.
<p>And many times have I found the magic of a sublime tango—a creation
of true art and intimacy with another.&nbsp; But I must confess that these
times seem to have little to do with the effort that I put into the craft
of dancing, and more to do with forgetting everything I learned and dancing
from my heart and soul while touching the heart and soul of another.
<p>What then is the search for the perfect tango in obsessive practice?&nbsp;
For me, it has largely been an activity that fills the needs of the ego
rather than nourishing my heart and soul—perfecting the craft and ignoring
the art.&nbsp; Too often have I obsessed and searched for the perfect tango—never
fully realizing that it is always at hand.
