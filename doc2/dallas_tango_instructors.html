Nasrin has a multifaceted and eclectic dance background and training in
diverse styles of dance since the age of 8.&nbsp; She was teaching and
performing Middle Eastern dances long before she was lured to Tango.&nbsp;
Her obsession for tango was inspired with Astor Piazzolla's music when she
was studying classical music.&nbsp; Her strong background in yoga, martial
arts and multitude of skill has given her the incisive ability to analyze
movement and help to improve a student’s technique on even the most subtle
levels.&nbsp; In addition, Nasrin both follows and leads, giving her further
insight into the technique of and relationship between the two roles. Technique
is always the focus point of her teaching.
<p>Nasrin and Hassan: In their dance, passion ignites, fantasies unfold
and romance, desire, rejection, separation come alive.&nbsp; Nasrin and Hassan
have both studied in the United States and in Buenos Aires, Argentina with
multitude of great masters.&nbsp; These energetic instructors focus on
a fusion of open and close embrace tango ideologies.&nbsp; Connection,
musicality, floorcraft, proper posture, balance, improvisation (the very
nature of art) and technique are emphasized extensively through all their
classes.&nbsp; Currently, as a dance couple they are dedicating most of
their time to dancing and teaching tango.&nbsp; They are available for
private and group lessons, exhibitions and shows.

<i>John Trimble</i></b> cultivates the connection between dancers to foster musicality,
improvisation and self-expression. Known as an adept follower as well as
a sensitive leader, he promotes a thorough understanding of the contributions
of both dancers. John emphasizes technique, including balance, posture,
and muscle tone in pursuit of the perfect tango.
<p>John's love of Argentine music predates his dancing. A long-time musician
and fan of Carlos Gardel and Astor Piazzolla, he first encountered Argentine
tango as a living dance at a Pablo Ziegler concert in 1996. John studies
and performs ballet, jazz and hip-hop and other social and folk dances
and brings this wealth of knowledge to his instruction.
<p>John has studied tango with many masters. He teaches Argentine tango at the
SMU Ballroom Dance club and has also taught at <i>I Dance 2</i> and <i>Salon Pavadita</i>.
<p><b><i>Lydia Rocio Essary</i></b> has studied with many masters in the studios and
milongas of Buenos Aires and the United States. She also studied ballet, modern and
flamenco dance.
<p>Lydia Rocio grew up listening to her father's tango record collection and studied
music and dance from an early age. A classically trained pianist, she has a special
admiration for the music of Bach, Beethoven and Piazzolla.
<p>Lydia's dance style is musical and technically elegant with a South
American flavor. She follows the New Tango school of Fabian Salas, and
favors the lighthearted spirit of Diego and Carolina along with the importance
of technique promoted by Graciela Gonzalez. "There is no real beauty without
balance," says Lydia. "A good follower maintains her axis and respects
her partner's boundaries, and vice versa."
<p>Lydia balances her passion for tango and cultivation of the arts with a
busy professional life. She has taught with John at Dance Institute of Dallas,
the SMU Ballroom Dance Club and in Southlake and Grapevine and performs with him regularly.

Having been born to an Argentinean and musical family, George began his music education
and exposure to Tango early on in life.  George started formal music training at the age
of 10 and continued though high school and college.  During these years his teachers
noticed his exceptional musical ability, and with their encouragement he expanded his
knowledge by learning several instruments.  In 1992, George discovered Shaolin Kung Fu,
and through constant diligence and patience, he became Senior Instructor and performed
demonstrations in several cities in the United States.
<p>A native of Caracas, Venezuela, Jairelbhi Furlong began her dance training at the age of 9.
She joined Las Voces Blancas, one of the top dance schools for kids. Jairelbhi was exposed
to several different dances but clearly her passion was tap dancing, and was asked to be an
assistant instructor.  Because of her graceful movements and perseverance she became part of
a dance troupe in Las Voces Blancas traveling to many places and included television performances.
<p>Recognized for their musicality, George and Jairelbhi Furlong are a new and up and coming
Argentine tango couple.  They have performed in cities throughout Texas, where they reside,
and within the last two years have expanded to other cities including New York City and
Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Their big break came in 2003 performing in <i>Tango! Tango!</i> with
the Fort Worth Symphony and well known choreographer Hector Zaraspe. Since then they have been
invited to perform with bandoneonista Daniel Binelli and Opus Cuatro.  In 2005, they created
<i>EvolutionTango</i>, a dance troupe based in Dallas, Texas, and have produced, directed,
and choreographed  two tango productions: <i>Tango: Now and Then</i>, and <i>EvolutionTango</i>.
Today they continue their tango education studying with Carolina Zokalski and Diego DiFalco,
stars of the Broadway show <i>Forever Tango</i>.

Founders of the Dallas chapter of Mo.C.C.A., Movimiento Cultural
Canyengue Argentino, Val and Glenda are among the few tango
teachers in the United States who specialize in tango canyengue.&nbsp;
Having studied traditional tango for several years, both in the
United States and in Buenos Aires, they were introduced to this historic,
original style of tango by its world-renowned masters and teachers
Marta Anton and "El Gallego" Manolo.&nbsp; Drawn to the quirky, playful
character of the dance and the rhythmic cadence, they studied tango
canyengue extensively in its traditional form and with a contemporary
interpretation.&nbsp; In 2009, they were invited to perform at 
Los Lunes en Viejo Correo in Buenos Aires.  
<p>Believing that tango should above all, be fun, Val and Glenda
focus on connection, moving to the music, and intuitive
improvisation with a relaxed and friendly approach that makes
tango accessible and enjoyable for beginner dancers and provides
more experienced dancers the opportunity to express their own
personal style.
