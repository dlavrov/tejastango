Tango: A Brief History</h1>
by Susan August Brown
<p>The exact origins of tango—both the dance and the word itself—are lost
in myth and an unrecorded history. The generally accepted theory is that
in the mid-1800s, the African slaves who had been brought to Argentina or
their descendants began to influence the local culture. The word "tango"
may be straightforwardly African in origin, meaning "closed place" or
"reserved ground." Or it may derive from Portuguese (and from the Latin
verb tanguere, to touch) and was picked up by Africans on the slave ships.
Whatever its origin, the word "tango" had acquired the standard meaning of
the place where African slaves and free blacks gathered to dance by the
time Argentina banned slavery in 1853.
<p>During the later part of the 1800s and early 1900s, Argentina was
undergoing a massive immigration. In 1869, Buenos Aires had a population of
180,000. By 1914, its population was 1.5 million. The intermixing of African,
Spanish, Italian, British, Polish, Russian and native-born Argentines resulted
in a melting pot of cultures, and each borrowed dance and music from one
another. Traditional polkas, waltzes and mazurkas were mixed with the popular
habanera from Cuba and the candombe rhythms from Africa.
<p>Most immigrants were single men hoping to earn their fortunes in this
newly expanding country. They were typically poor and desperate, hoping
to make enough money to return to Europe or bring their families to Argentina.
The evolution of tango reflects their profound sense of loss and longing
for the people and places they left behind.
<p>Most likely, rudimentary dance forms that may have been known as "tango"
were developed in African-Argentine dance venues. These venues were frequented
by compadritos, young men—mostly native born, poor and of mixed ancestry—who
liked to dress in slouch hats, loosely tied neckerchiefs and high-heeled boots
with knives tucked casually into their belts. The compadritos took the dance to
the Corrales Viejos—the slaughterhouse district of Buenos Aires—and introduced it
in various low-life establishments where dancing took place: bars, dance halls
and brothels. It was in these tenements where the African rhythms met the
Argentine milonga music (a fast-paced polka). Soon new steps were invented and
took hold as a new form of dance that combined traditions from many cultures.
Exactly when and where the various forms of dance and music combined to create
what became widely understood as tango is unclear. What is clear was that tango
was considered a dance from the poor barrios.
<p>Although high society looked down upon the activities in the barrios,
well-heeled sons of the porte&ntilde;o oligarchy were not averse to slumming.
Eventually, everyone found out about the tango and, by the beginning of
the twentieth century, the tango as both a dance and as an embryonic form
of popular music had established a firm foothold in the fast-expanding
city of its birth. It soon spread to provincial towns of Argentina and
across the River Plate to Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, where it
became as much a part of the urban culture as in Buenos Aires.
<p>The worldwide spread of the tango came in the early 1900s when wealthy
sons of Argentine society families made their way to Paris and introduced
the tango into a society eager for innovation and not entirely averse to
the risqu&eacute; nature of the dance or dancing with young, wealthy Latin
men. By 1913, the tango had become an international phenomenon in Paris,
London and New York. There were tango teas, tango train excursions and
even tango colors—most notably orange. The Argentine elite who had shunned
the tango were now forced into accepting it with national pride.
<p>The tango spread worldwide throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The dance
appeared in movies and tango singers traveled the world. By the 1930s,
the Golden Age of Argentina was beginning. The country became one of the
ten richest nations in the world and music, poetry and culture flourished.
The tango came to be a fundamental expression of Argentine culture, and
the Golden Age lasted through the 1940s and 1950s.
<p>Tango's fortunes have always been tied to economic conditions and this
was very true in the 1950s. During this time, as political repression developed,
lyrics reflected political feelings until they started to be banned as
subversive. The dance and its music went underground as large dance venues
were closed and large gatherings in general were prohibited. The tango
survived in smaller, unpublicized venues and in the hearts of the people.
<p>The necessity of going underground combined with the eventual invasion
of rock and roll sent the tango into decline until the mid-1980s when the
stage show Tango Argentino opened in Paris. Once again Paris was ground
zero for igniting tango excitement worldwide. The show toured the world
and stimulated a revival in Europe, North America and Japan that we are
part of today.
