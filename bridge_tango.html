<h2>
<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
Between 1996 and 2001, Daniel Trenner produced 72 instructional videos
for his Bridge to the Tango label.&nbsp; The videos cover his own teaching
and dancing, Rebecca Shulman's and that of a number of other masters from
the older and younger generations.

<p>An era came to an end on January 1, 2007 when all Bridge to the Tango
instructional videos were officially withdrawn from the market.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
several vendors have remaining copies of most of the Bridge to the Tango videos
for sale in VHS format.&nbsp; Among the possible sources are
<a href="http://www.danieltrenner.com/store_s" target="new">Daniel Trenner's store</a> and
Phil Seyer's <a href="http://www.Argentine-tango.com/" target="new">Argentine Tango webpage</a>.&nbsp;
In addition, Daniel Trenner is in the process of releasing the material as video downloads
available through <a href="http://www.itangocafe.com" target="new">itangocafe.com</a>.&nbsp;
In addition, Daniel has recorded several new videos which are only available as video downloads.

<p>Information about the complete Bridge to the Tango catalog is available through
<a href="http://www.danieltrenner.com/store_s" target="new">Daniel Trenner's store</a>.

<p>My complete assessment of the Bridge to the Tango videos is below.

<p><i class="rate star3"></i><a NAME="Avellaneda_advanced"></a>Suzuki
Avellaneda (with Pablo Nievas) — <i>The Advanced Milonga of Pepito Avelleneda</i>&nbsp; <b>(VHS only)</b>
<br>The opening dance numbers, which feature Pepito and Suzuki together,
show why Pepito was a well-regarded milonguero who had many
students.&nbsp; Pepito taught his wife Suzuki most of his material.&nbsp;
In this video, produced by the Bridge to the Tango, Suzuki and Pablo Nievas
(one of Pepito's long-time students) demonstrate more than 20 of Pepito's
more complex milonga figures, most of which are different than those taught
in the advanced volume of the <a href="video_resources.html#Avellaneda_milonga">Asi
Se Baila Milonga</a> series listed on the page <a href="video_resources.html">Video
Resources for the Tango Dancer</a>.&nbsp; Because few of the figures are broken
down and explained in detail, most viewers will need to be prepared with the rewind
and slow-motion buttons on their VCRs.&nbsp; The video includes studio performances by
Suzuki and Pablo in Pepito's style.&nbsp; Produced by Bridge to the Tango.&nbsp;
The VHS tape is officially withdrawn from the market, but it is likely still available.&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="Bravo"></a><b>Raul Bravo</b> had a career as an exhibition
tango dancer in the 1960s which included touring with the Mariano Mores
orchestra.&nbsp; During that period, he also owned and operated a tango
school with the late Antonio Todaro, who became the well-known instructor
of many of today’s stars.
<p><i class="rate star3"></i><a NAME="Bravo_turning"></a>Raul
Bravo — <i>Intermediate/Advanced Turning Figures</i>&nbsp; <b>(VHS only)</b>
<br>On this video, Raul Bravo is assisted by Laura Rosen in teaching elements
important in the development of social and stage tango.&nbsp; After an
initial demonstration dance, Bravo teaches three variations of the crossed-foot
basic.&nbsp; He then proceeds to teach many figures that include variations
and applications of clockwise and counter-clockwise turns incorporating
such elements as sacadas, arrastres, planeos, boleos, ganchos, needles,
and change of profile.&nbsp; The advanced section includes some lengthy
combinations.&nbsp; Although Bravo explains and repeats many of the figures,
those wanting to learn the figures are likely to find themselves making
extensive use of the rewind and slow-motion buttons on their VCRs.&nbsp;
Most of the material presented on the video has long been incorporated
in the standard repertoire for stage dancing and is better executed by
other dancers, but Bravo’s historical perspective is interesting.&nbsp;
The video is probably best suited for dancers who already have a good mastery
of tango skills and are interested in developing figures for exhibition
tango dancing, but some of the material would occasionally be useful in
salon- and orillero-style social dancing.&nbsp; Produced by Bridge to the
Tango.&nbsp; The VHS tape is officially withdrawn from the
market, but it is likely still available.&nbsp; For more information, see

<p><i class="rate star3"></i><a NAME="Bruno_kid"></a>Juan
Bruno — <i>The Kid from Ciudadela</i>&nbsp; <b>(Video Download or VHS)</b>
<br>In this video, Juan Bruno teaches lead and follow and demonstrates
more than 40 figures in both salon- and orillero-style tango.&nbsp; The
video includes eight demonstration dances in which Daniel and Rebecca serve
as Juan Bruno's partners.&nbsp; Potentially an historic treasure, this
video is particularly recommended for dancers who are looking for something
a little different.&nbsp; Produced by Bridge to the Tango.&nbsp; The VHS
tape is officially withdrawn from the market, but it is likely still
available.&nbsp; For more information, see

<p><a NAME="Cappussi/Flores"></a><b>Eduardo Cappussi and Mariana Flores.</b>&nbsp;
Eduardo Cappussi "El Brujo" is known for his colorful and dramatic fantasia
dancing.
<p><i class="rate star4"></i><a NAME="Cappussi/Flores_brujo"></a>Eduardo
Cappussi and Mariana Flores — <i>The Tango of El Brujo</i>&nbsp; <b>(VHS only)</b>
<br>The opening dance sequence shows why El Brujo is known as a colorful
character among the younger generation of tango dancers.&nbsp; His style
is characterized by unique figures and astounding double-tempo rhythms.&nbsp;
This video documents more than 20 figures and variations, showing how El
Brujo adapts the traditional tango vocabulary to his own expression.&nbsp;
Taken individually, some of the elements would be suitable for an intermediate
to advanced social dancer, but some are better suited for those who want
to create outrageous choreography.&nbsp; Add half a star if you are interested
in obtaining a visual record of an unique style that is sometimes outrageous
and sometimes beautiful.&nbsp; Produced by Bridge to the Tango.&nbsp; The VHS
tape is officially withdrawn from the market, but it is likely still
available.&nbsp; For more information, see

<p><i class="rate star3_5"></i><a NAME="Castello_tango"></a>Puppy
Castello (with Luciana Valle) — <i>The Tango of Puppy Castello</i>&nbsp; <b>(Video Download or VHS)</b>
<br>Those who watch this video may wonder why Puppy is known as one of
tango's most colorful characters.&nbsp; What they will see is a careful
documentation of Puppy's style of dancing and the clarity of his teaching.&nbsp;
This 55 minute video is packed with material for the intermediate tango
dancer including salidas, ochos, half turns, turns, walking, enrosques,
sacadas, ganchos, boleos, barridas, planeos, adornments and some combinations.&nbsp;
Throughout the video, Puppy discusses many details of technique for both
men and the women.&nbsp; The demonstration dances show Puppy's incredible
balance and slow movement to great advantage.&nbsp; Produced by Bridge
to the Tango.&nbsp; The VHS tape is officially withdrawn from the market, but it is
likely still available.&nbsp; For more information, see

couples in the rapid expansion of salon-style tango in the 1980s and 1990s.&nbsp;
Maria and the late Rodolfo were known for incredibly fast and precise footwork,
style, and the musicality of their dancing.&nbsp; They were also known
for their canyengue-style dancing, which is not captured on any widely
distributed videos.

<br>In this video, Maria and Rodolfo cover the basics of their salon-style
tango, some intermediate figures, and some advanced turns.&nbsp; They integrate
adornments into many of their figures.&nbsp; In a departure from most instruction,
Maria discusses the woman's role in each figure, as well as the dance as
a whole.&nbsp; The video includes three performance demonstrations and
many short demonstrations.&nbsp; Instruction is clear, but be prepared
with rewind and slow-motion buttons.&nbsp; Produced by Bridge to the Tango.&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="DiFalco/Zokalski"></a><b>Diego Di Falco and Carolina Zokalski</b>
are two young stars in the world of theatrical tango.&nbsp; They toured
with <i>Forever Tango</i>, including its stay on Broadway, and they appeared
in the PBS special <i>Tango Magic</i>.&nbsp; Diego trained with the late
master Antonio Todaro.&nbsp; Together their dancing is stunning and compelling.&nbsp;
They are highly regarded as teachers.
<p><i class="rate star4_5"></i><a NAME="DiFalco/Zokalski_stage"></a>Diego
Di Falco and Carolina Zokalski — <i>Tango Techniques for the Stage</i>
(3 volumes)&nbsp; <b>(VHS only)</b>
<br>After getting past my initial disappointment that this three-video
series is somewhat disorganized and not quite as comprehensive as I had
hoped, I found a wealth of information for dancers who wish to perform
tango exhibitions.&nbsp; In the first video, Carolina and Diego teach some
figures useful for performance tango, and use those figures to explain
and demonstrate working with music, creating variations, proper techniques
for managing energy, and the use of improvisation versus choreography.&nbsp;
The second video, they discuss, demonstrate and teach adjusting the choreography
to face the audience on different types of stages, directions on movement
on stage, elements of creating choreography from entrance to finish.&nbsp;
As the last instructional element in the second video, Carolina and Diego
teach the first segment of a choreography.&nbsp; The third video is the
remaining seven segments of that choreography.&nbsp; The choreography demonstrates
many of the principles taught&nbsp;&nbsp; The complete choreography demonstrates
most of the principles taught in the first two videos.&nbsp; Throughout
the videos, Diego and Carolina carefully explain everything through translator
Daniel Trenner including the man's and woman's parts and many of the techniques
for leading and following.&nbsp; The production is very well done.&nbsp;
Produced by Bridge to the Tango.&nbsp; The VHS tapes are officially withdrawn
from the market, but they are likely still available.&nbsp; For more information, see

<p><i class="rate star4"></i><a NAME="DiFalco/Zokalski_leader"></a>Diego
Di Falco and Carolina Zokalski — <i>Leader's Tango Technique</i>&nbsp; <b>(Video Download or VHS)</b>
<br>In this video, Diego covers many elements of the man’s skills in salon
tango including posture, balance, walking, the embrace, turns, sacadas,
and lapiz, as well as man's boleos and ganchos.&nbsp; Despite its title,
the video emphasizes techniques for the man's steps over skills for leading
the woman.&nbsp; General leading technique is discussed toward the beginning,
and techniques for leading turns are covered, but the techniques for leading
boleos, amagues, ganchos, planeos and sacadas are covered in Diego and
Carolina's video of follower's technique listed below.&nbsp; Carolina frequently
joins Diego to demonstrate his movements, and they also provide a demonstration
dance.&nbsp; The instruction would be particularly useful for leaders of
all levels who are looking to improve their basic skills in salon tango,
but viewers should recognize that techniques for dancing tango vary across
individuals, and some of the techniques Diego recommends might not be used
by other dancers of comparable ability.&nbsp; Produced by Bridge to the
Tango.&nbsp; The VHS tape is officially withdrawn from the
market, but it is likely still available.&nbsp; For more information, see

<br>In this video, Carolina shares many of the details of her technique
through demonstrations and analysis of the embrace, posture, walking, ochos,
turns, ganchos, boleos, planeos, sacadas and adornments. Diego joins Carolina
for demonstrations of technique and he also teaches the techniques for
leading boleos, amagues, ganchos, planeos and sacadas.&nbsp; The video
also includes two dance demonstrations.&nbsp; The instruction would be
particularly useful for followers of all levels who are looking to improve
their basic skills in salon tango.&nbsp; Produced by Bridge to the Tango.&nbsp;

<br>Carolina and Diego interpret the term "salon tango" to mean off-the-body
social dancing.&nbsp; In this video, they present five interesting and
complex figures based upon walking that they intend for advanced social
dancing.&nbsp; The instruction is quite clear, and Diego and Carolina carefully
explain the men's and women's parts through translator Daniel Trenner.&nbsp;
They also dance two demonstration dances that many viewers will enjoy watching.

Di Falco and Carolina Zokalski — <i>Tango Waltz Figures</i>&nbsp; <b>(Video Download or VHS)</b>
<br>The opening demonstration dance shows the beauty and fluidity that
can be achieved in dancing Argentine waltz.&nbsp; After the opening dance,
Carolina and Diego present 12 advanced figures in an open-embrace style
of dancing.&nbsp; The figures are absolutely stunning and illustrate variations
in turns, as well as pivots, sacadas, corridas, cadenas, and llevadas,
as well as&nbsp; the use of syncopation.&nbsp; Diego and Carolina carefully
explain the men's and women's steps through translator Daniel Trenner,
but in keeping with the advanced nature of the video, they presume the
viewers already have a sound knowledge of leading and following techniques.&nbsp;

<br>In this video, Zoraida and Diego explain what they consider the basic
walks and turns of milonga, which seems more like tango.&nbsp; As is evident
in their own off-tempo demonstration dances, Zoraida and Diego do not sufficiently
adjust the steps from the slower-paced tango to accommodate the rhythmic
needs of milonga.&nbsp; The section on vals crusado (Argentine waltz) is
considerably better, but they never explain the rhythm, and they drop the
rhythm on one of three demonstration waltzes.&nbsp; Produced by Bridge to the

"Chicho" Frumboli (with Brooke Burdett) — <i>Boleos and Ganchos</i>&nbsp; <b>(VHS only)</b>
<br>In this 90 minute video, Chicho covers the basic structure of turns,
as well as techniques for boleos and ganchos from a variety of positions.&nbsp;
Chicho’s instruction takes what many would consider interesting but conventional
elements of salon and fantasia tango and subjects them to a theoretical
analysis that some will find excruciatingly detailed, but others will find
reveal elements of the structure of tango.&nbsp; In this analysis, boleos
and ganchos are seen as elements of turns.&nbsp; Because the theoretical
analysis precedes the demonstration of each specific element, dancers who
do not already know how to execute at least some boleos and ganchos are
likely to find the instruction difficult to follow.&nbsp; Most leaders
and some followers will find the instruction in positioning will help them
to refine their ability to execute boleos and ganchos.&nbsp; The technique
Chicho teaches for women in executing a back boleo should be avoided, however,
because it could result in a knee injury.&nbsp; (Correct instruction is
provided on the video tapes of follower's technique by <a href="#DiFalco/Zokalski_follower">Diego
Di Falco and Carolina Zokalski</a>, <a href="#Shulman_followers">Rebecca
Shulman</a>, and <a href="#Taccetti_followers">Florencia Taccetti</a>.)&nbsp;
In contrast with most of the rest of the video, the brief section on boleos
to the front is quite clear and easy to follow.&nbsp; The four demonstration
dances suggest that Chicho's tango skills are more of the mind than on
the dance floor.&nbsp; The video is likely to be most useful to those who
already know at least a few boleos and ganchos and want to develop a theoretical
understanding of their place in tango's structure.&nbsp; Produced by Bridge

"Chicho" Frumboli (with Sharna Fabiano) — <i>Changes of Direction in Turns</i>&nbsp; <b>(VHS only)</b>
<br>On this 60 minute video, Chicho comprehensively covers the structure
of changes of direction in turns, and he teaches a variety of advanced
applications including cadenas (chains) and the incorporation of boleos
and ganchos into changes of direction.&nbsp; In his presentation on structure,
Chicho clarifies and simplifies what many consider a complex subject, but
his presentation may lose some viewers because he discusses the theory
and details before showing the resulting movements.&nbsp; The applied sections
and demonstration dances show some of the interesting movements that can
be created by changing directions in turns.&nbsp; A few of the applications
seem ugly, but much of the material would be useful for social or stage
dancing.&nbsp; Chicho's presentation presumes the viewer understands the
structure of turns as well as the boleos and ganchos presented on his preceding
video, "Boleos and Ganchos" (listed immediately above), but the video should
prove accessible to accomplished tango dancers.&nbsp; As such, the video

explores basic elements of her beautiful technique in a generally clear
and well-organized manner.&nbsp; She covers posture, walking, shifts in
weight, ochos, giros, boleos, the embrace and adornments.&nbsp; Teaching
in low-heeled jazz shoes throughout the video, Fernanda recommends that
women dance with their weight over their toes in a manner that approaches
leaning on their partners.&nbsp; Fernanda does not explain how the technique
changes when the woman is wearing 4" heels, but the beautiful closing demonstration
dance clearly shows the heels on Fernanda's shoes on the floor, which is
absolutely necessary if the woman is to maintain balance.&nbsp; Fernanda

<br>These three videos examine how to put together a stage performance
of tango.&nbsp; The emphasis is on how to construct a choreography that
tells a story rather than the mastery of figures used in stage dancing.&nbsp;
Volume 1 (the strongest of the three videos) covers the use of space, directions
on stage, projecting attitude and personality, building a story, variation
in the music, dynamics, entrances, the first step, exits, and finales.&nbsp;
It opens and closes with complete dances and contains numerous demonstrations
of the various elements.&nbsp; Volume 2 opens with the demonstration of
a complete choreography.&nbsp; After the demonstration, Fernanda and Guillermo
go through the choreography in considerable detail explaining how they
used imagination, the music and the elements covered in volume 1 to create
the choreography.&nbsp; The video closes with a repeat screening of the

and demontrate the use of music and the development of clarity in who is
moving.&nbsp; They also extensively examine how a variety of emotions can

that Gustavo Naveira and Olga Besio taught during an advanced workshop
in Buenos Aires in early 1999.&nbsp; The videos present an advanced analysis
of tango's structure with a series of interwoven figures that variously
combine the crossed basic, cross and parallel walking, corridas, ochos,
turns, boleos, ganchos, planeos, sacadas, barridas, enrosques and changes
of direction in turns.&nbsp; Although the videos are of classroom instruction,
the distillation is quite successful in capturing the interesting material
that Gustavo and Olga taught.&nbsp; Instruction takes a relatively leisurely
pace in which Gustavo and Olga first demonstrate a figure, and then Gustavo
carefully explains the details of the movement in Spanish.&nbsp; An interpreter

<br>In this 55-minute video, Tommy O'Connell shares his unique style of
milonga that he calls "falecty."&nbsp; The falcety is a shuffle step done
in double time that is derived from the Argentine folk dance, chameme.&nbsp;
The general effect is a lazier, perhaps more versatile traspie, in which
a shuffle replaces the rocking of traspie movements.&nbsp; After explaining
how he learned this relatively unique form of milonga, Tommy teaches the
basic chameme rhythm.&nbsp; He then proceeds to teach falcety variations
of numerous elements of milonga.&nbsp; With Elina Roldan as his partner,
Tommy demonstrates most movements to chameme music, then milonga music.&nbsp;
He follows up by teaching each step to Daniel Trenner dancing with Elina.&nbsp;
The specific steps are less important to the style than the falcety rhythm,
although Tommy demands that Daniel do each step exactly as demonstrated.&nbsp;
For instructional purposes, the material is best suited to those who have
a command of basic milonga, can learn from watching, and want to add some
falcety elements to their dancing.&nbsp; Be prepared with the rewind button,

<p><a NAME="Pugliese"></a><b>Mingo, Esther and Pablo Pugliese.</b>&nbsp;
Mingo Pugliese is regarded among the great tango educators of his generation.&nbsp;
He distilled the innovative concepts developed by "Petroleo" and Salvador
Sciana during the golden age of tango into eight-count right and left turns
(giros) that can be used as a frame of reference for all turning steps.&nbsp;
Together with his wife Esther, Mingo has taught many of the young tango
stars of today, including their son Pablo.&nbsp; Using what is now the
family method, Esther and Pablo teamed up for several highly successful
teaching tours of the United States including the Stanford Tango Weeks
in 1996 and 1997.&nbsp; Pablo now established as an exciting performer,
resides in the United States and performs and teaches with other partners.

<p><a NAME="Pulpo"></a><b>El Pulpo.</b>&nbsp; Starting at a relatively
young age, Norberto Esbrez "El Pulpo" has been dancing tango for about
25 years.&nbsp; He is known for a complicated, deliberate, languid and
turning style of Argentine tango that is densely packed with unusual adornments.&nbsp;
For some observers, El Pulpo's style evokes an image of an octopus, hence
his nickname "El Pulpo" (the Octopus).&nbsp; <b>Luiza Paes</b> was his long-time
partner and mastered the woman's counterpart to El Pulpo's style.
<p><i class="rate star4_5"></i><a NAME="Pulpo_technique"></a>Norberto
Esbrez "El Pulpo" and Luiza Paes — <i>The Technique of El Pulpo</i>&nbsp; <b>(VHS only)</b>
<br>The first video of a three-video series that continues with <a href="#Pulpo_art">The
Art of El Pulpo</a>, this video introduces the basic movements and techniques
of El Pulpo's unique approach to dancing Argentine tango.&nbsp; After an
introductory dance, instruction starts with the eight-count basic.&nbsp;
Using the steps of the eight-count basic as reference points, El Pulpo
and Luiza cover 15 elements of El Pulpo's style, including turns, salidas,
ochos, molinetes, sacadas and changing the angles of steps.&nbsp; In the
process of covering these elements, El Pulpo and Luiza teach movements
and techniques that are essential for El Pulpo's approach to tango.&nbsp;
The instruction follows a logical progression through the movements, and
El Pulpo and Luiza are very clear and careful in their instruction.&nbsp;
Perhaps the key insight of the video is in the use of pivots to change
the direction of a step.&nbsp; Some of the techniques El Pulpo and Luiza
teach are not universal to Argentine tango and will require modification
by those leaders who don't wish to emulate El Pulpo's slouchy posture.&nbsp;
El Pulpo teaches in Spanish, and Luiza provides English translation and
instruction.&nbsp; The video is best suited to those who have at least
a basic knowledge of Argentine tango and want to learn elements of El Pulpo's

<a href="#Pulpo_technique">The
Technique of El Pulpo</a>, these two videos explore more deeply El Pulpo's
unique approach to dancing Argentine tango.&nbsp; Each video opens with
an exhibition dance.&nbsp; Volume 1 covers a variety of El Pulpo's ideas
about using sacadas, agarres, enganches and ganchos in a variety of combinations.&nbsp;
Volume 2 continues the instruction, eventually progressing to step patterns
that seem like a labyrinth of interwoven sacadas, enganches, boleos and
ganchos including figures known as El Pulpo and the Roman combination.&nbsp;
The instruction follows a logical progression through all the material,
and El Pulpo and Luiza are very clear and careful in their instruction.&nbsp;
The gentleness with which El Pulpo executes his frequent back sacadas is
instructive in its own right.&nbsp; El Pulpo's apparent disregard for the
line of dance and the stationary nature of some the combinations will have
some viewers thinking stage tango.&nbsp; His slow movements and slouchy
posture will not.&nbsp; Some of the techniques will require modification
by those leaders who don't wish to emulate El Pulpo's posture.&nbsp; El
Pulpo teaches in Spanish, and Luiza provides English translation and instruction.&nbsp;

<br>In this video, Elina Roldan teaches follower's technique for exhibition
dancing that is generally faithful to salon tango.&nbsp; For the instructional
portion of the video, Daniel Trenner serves as her partner and provides
translation.&nbsp; After nearly a 20 minute interview, Elina takes 50 minutes
to cover very basic techniques for the embrace, posture, walking, forward
and backward ochos, the cross, turns, planeos and barridas.&nbsp; She also
demonstrates overturn ochos and the differences between social and stage
adornments.&nbsp; Elina's explanations are generally clear and highly detailed,
typically relying more on words than movement.&nbsp; A few of Elina's explanations
are at variance with her dancing, and not all of the techniques that she
teaches are universally accepted for stage dancing.&nbsp; Elina doesn't
cover ganchos, sentadas, sacadas, leg wraps, jumps, lifts or poses — all
of which are likely to be found in tango performances.&nbsp; Nor does she
really explain the demands of dancing for an audience.&nbsp; The video
probably is best suited for beginning tango dancers who have had little
instruction in basic technique and intend to dance performance tango in

Roldan and Julio Mendez — <i>Combining Two Popular Styles</i>&nbsp; <b>(VHS only)</b>
<br>Many have learned to dance tango in both a close-embrace salon style
as well as a more open-embrace style in which counter-rotating movements
are possible.&nbsp; Some may wish to develop a better understanding of
the differences in technique and options between the two styles.&nbsp;
Others may wish to combine the two styles to create what some now call
liquid tango.&nbsp; After beginning with a demonstration dance, Elina and
Julio teach a number of elements of tango (including turns, ochos, boleos,
sacadas and walks) to illustrate how the techniques and steps for the two
styles differ.&nbsp; The video is rich in ideas for each style of tango
and clarifies the differences, but it contains much less about combining
the two styles.&nbsp; Only the final section presents a step sequence that
combines the two styles, and it may leave more than a few viewers wondering
whether the two styles are as distinct as Elina and Julio suggest.&nbsp;

traditional milonga and then show how to incorporate traspie elements into
the dance.&nbsp; For traditional tango they cover single and double time
rhythms, musicality, changing directions, a walking basic, forward ocho,
backward ocho, variations on the salida in double time, and a follower's
double cross.&nbsp; For traspie they cover the basic traspie movement,
changing directions, turning, salida and side step.&nbsp; The basic to
intermediate material on this video fits well together and coverage progresses
in a logical order.&nbsp; Anyone who masters all of the material on the
video will have a solid foundation for dancing milonga.&nbsp; The opening
exhibition and numerous snippets of Elina and Julio demonstrating what
they have taught reveals dancers with an excellent command of milonga.&nbsp;
The teaching is sketchy, focuses primarily on the leader's role, and presumes
that those who are watching have a fairly good knowledge of milonga.&nbsp;
Nearly all elements are taught before they are demonstrated which makes
it difficult to follow what is being taught without repeated use of the
fast forward and rewind buttons.&nbsp; The pace of instruction is slowed
considerably by the fact that explanations are first offered in Spanish
and then English translation.&nbsp; Produced by Bridge to the Tango.&nbsp;

amagues, ganchos and adornments.&nbsp; Among the adornments that Florencia
examines are those used with walking steps, ochos, turns, sandwiches and
calesitas.&nbsp; She also briefly addresses ochos, turns and adornments
in close-embrace style tango, as well as the use of adornments in milonga
and vals.&nbsp; In teaching adornments, Florencia emphasizes technique
over specific adornments, encouraging students to develop their own adornments.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, Florencia demonstrates many of her own adornments.&nbsp;
Although the video seems a bit slow at the beginning and a little rushed
toward the end, the instruction on the video is extremely clear and well
organized like Florencia’s classes.&nbsp; On the video, Florencia teaches
in Spanish, and Brooke Burdett provides English translation.&nbsp; Occasionally
both are talking at the same time, and at these times I found it difficult
to concentrate on either speaker.&nbsp; While teaching, Florencia is always
careful to present the proper angle in this one-camera production.&nbsp;

music, the video includes five demonstration dances showing Florencia’s
technique—four with Julio Mendez serving as her partner and one with Daniel

with milonguero-style dancing.&nbsp; The video's overall effect is more
like a casual afternoon of discussion and demonstration than a formal course
of instruction, and the emphasis is on technique rather than basic steps.&nbsp;
Despite the lengthy discussions, most viewers who want to learn the step
patterns will find themselves using the rewind and slow-motion buttons
on their VCRs extensively.&nbsp; The video would be most useful to dancers
who already dance milonguero-style tango and want to improve their knowledge
of the style.&nbsp; Add a star if you are interested in a visual record
of Tete's style of dancing tango.&nbsp; Produced by Bridge to the Tango.&nbsp;

<br>The numerous dance sequences on this video capture the musical, spontaneous
and flowing manner with which Tete and Silvia dance tango in waltz rhythm,
but not Tete's commanding technique.&nbsp; In the instructional parts of
the video, Tete and Silvia cover turns, enrosques, change of sides in back
ochos, sacadas, continuous resolutions, mirrored ochos, and the concept
of dancing to tango waltz music.&nbsp; In doing so, they convey a number
of essential elements of Tete's style of dancing vals.&nbsp; Most viewers
who want to learn the step patterns will find themselves using the rewind
and slow-motion buttons on their VCRs extensively.&nbsp; The material
on this video is best understood as an extension of that taught on Tete's
and Silvia'’s <i>Fundamentals of Salon Tango</i> (listed immediately above),
but it should be accessible to those who already have a good knowledge

<p><a NAME="Trenner/Shulman"></a><b>Daniel Trenner and Rebecca Shulman</b>
remain fairly unique among North American tango instructors in emphasizing

<br>These three instructional videos emphasize the structure, improvisation
and tango skills essential for developing a mastery of tango.&nbsp; Many
of Daniel and Rebecca's more ardent followers, who consider the material
very important to learning Argentine Tango, rate these tapes more highly
than I have.&nbsp; If the production values were better and explanations
more thorough, I would agree.&nbsp; Production quality and the explanations

<br>Milonguero style tango (also known as apilado-, cafe-, and club-style
tango) is quite popular in some crowded night clubs of central Buenos Aires,
and it is becoming increasingly popular in the United States.&nbsp; In
this intermediate video, Daniel and Rebecca teach milonguero-style as a
departure from the salon style that is more prevalent in the U.S.&nbsp;
They teach changes in frame, in techniques for legs, and in the structure
of the dance, including salidas, ochos, right and left turns and back corridas.&nbsp;
Their approach assumes a familiarity with salon-style tango.&nbsp; Produced

other basic elements and some complicated variations.&nbsp; For those interested

<br>Daniel and Rebecca once kindled controversy through public performances
of a genderless tango in which lead and follow are exchanged between partners.&nbsp;
They occasionally taught this way of dancing and seemed propose it as a
way to dance socially.&nbsp; The video starts with some exercises that
would be useful for anyone interested in deepening their knowledge of tango
and then progresses to the specific skills necessary to exchange lead and
follow.&nbsp; The latter material is best suited to dancers who have sufficient
knowledge of both parts and do not feel bound by tradition.&nbsp; The instruction
is clear and maybe too thorough, but the dancing is uninspired.&nbsp; The
rating does not reflect the reviewer's opinion of this style of dance.&nbsp;

<br>Omar was internationally famous for his relatively simple but extremely

than 20 steps and variations, including paseos, symmetrical figures, giros,
and traspies.&nbsp; Some figures are broken down and explained carefully
from the man's perspective.&nbsp; Some are just demonstrated.&nbsp; Many
dancers would find knowledge of the steps to provide a useful basis for
building a command of milonga, but Omar's dancing on the video suffers

<p><a NAME="Zotto/Ermocida"></a><b>Osvaldo Zotto and Lorena Ermocida</b>
were among the greatest couples to ever dance tango fantasia (exhibition tango).&nbsp;
They also were outstanding practitioners of salon tango and excellent and
generous teachers.
<p><i class="rate star4_5"></i><a NAME="Zotto/Ermocida_advanced"></a>Osvaldo
Zotto and Lorena Ermocida — Advanced Training in Buenos Aires&nbsp; <b>(5 Video Downloads or VHS tapes)</b>
<br>This five-video series is a distillation of 35 hours of instruction
that Osvaldo and Lorena taught during an advanced workshop organized by
Bridge to the Tango in early 2000.&nbsp; During the workshop, Osvaldo and
Lorena taught 15 sequences of tango figures, seven figures in milonga and
milonga traspie, two sequences of vals, a section of tango choreography,
dancing to different styles of music, and women's technique.&nbsp; Each
of the tango and vals sequences on the videos involves many elements of
the tango vocabulary.&nbsp; Osvaldo and Lorena carefully explain the techniques
required for each element of tango, vals and milonga they teach.&nbsp;
Although the five-video series records instruction in a classroom setting,
only the demonstrations and explanations of this advanced material are
shown.&nbsp; Because the material is advanced and much is taught in lengthy
sequences, the viewer must pay close attention or the instruction will
begin to seem disjointed.&nbsp; Volume 1 contains six tango sequences and
instruction on women's technique.&nbsp; Volume 2 contains seven figures
of milonga and milonga traspie and two sequences of tango.&nbsp; Volume
3 contains two sequences of vals and one lengthy sequence of tango.&nbsp;
Volume 4 contains a section of tango choreography and three sequences of
tango figures.&nbsp; Volume 5 covers some steps for dancing to the music
of Pugliese, Cal&oacute; and D'Arienzo and three sequences of tango figures.&nbsp;
Osvaldo and Lorena open each video with a stunning demonstration dance.&nbsp;
Osvaldo teaches in Spanish with Lorena providing translation, and Lorena
teaches in English.&nbsp; The one-camera classroom production involves
some compromises in sound quality and limits the angles from which the
steps and figures are shown.&nbsp; Produced by Bridge to the Tango.&nbsp;
The VHS tapes are officially discontinued, but they are likely still available.&nbsp;

<h2>
<a NAME="Milonguero"></a>Videos about Milonguero-Style Tango</h2>
Tango is typically danced in a close embrace in the crowded clubs of central
Buenos Aires. One of these close-embrace styles is commonly known as "apilado-style"
in Buenos Aires and "milonguero-style" in the United States, but it can
also be referred to as caf&eacute;-, confiteria-, club- or salon-style.&nbsp;
Milonguero-style tango is characterized by a close chest-to-chest embrace
and the use of some double-time dance steps.&nbsp; Some dancers distinguish
between club- and milonguero-style tango.&nbsp; Club-style tango uses a
close but slightly offset embrace and has some double-time dance steps.&nbsp;
It also allows for a slight separation in turns, which permits a wider
variety of steps than the milonguero style.
<p>Bridge to the Tango offered a number of videos about milonguero-style
tango.

<h2>
<a NAME="Orillero"></a>Videos about Orillero-Style Tango</h2>
Orillero-style tango may have been developed in the outlying neighborhoods
of and around Buenos Aires where there was more space on dance floors,
or it may have its origins in the streets of poor outlying tenements.&nbsp;
Orillero-style tango is characterized by highly rhythmic movement and playful
space-consuming embellishments and figures that do not always respect the
line of dance.
<p>Bridge to the Tango produced the only two videos about orillero-style
tango.

<h2>
<a NAME="Canyengue"></a>Videos about Canyengue-Style Tango</h2>
Canyengue was a dominant style of tango during the 1920s and early 30s,
but it was subsumed into other social styles during the golden age of tango.&nbsp;
No visual records exist of canyengue danced during its own era.&nbsp; Some
older milongueros have recreated the style from their memories of the way
their parents generation danced.&nbsp; Written records suggest some authenticity
in these recreated styles, but no one can know for certain how canyengue
was really danced.
<p>Bridge to the Tango produced one video about canyengue-style tango.

<a NAME="Fantasia"></a>Videos about Tango Fantasia and Tango Escenario (Exhibition and Stage Tango)</h2>
Stage performances of Argentine tango are typically choreographed, and
choreographed tango can range from ballet with elements of tango to tango
with elements of ballet. Occasionally performances are improvised with
balletic elements and complex figures integrated into the open-embrace
style of tango.
<p>Bridge to the Tango produced a number of videos about tango fantasia.

and typically without any pauses, milonga is a very rhythmic dance that
most often is danced with less complicated movements.

<h2>
<a NAME="Individual_Styles"></a>Videos Documenting an Individual Style</h2>
One of the contributions of instructional videos taught by tango masters
is in documenting an individual or influential style.&nbsp; To some extent,
all of the instructional videos document a particular style, but the following
videos are particularly noteworthy in documenting individual or influential
styles.&nbsp; I am particularly fond of the Bridge to the Tango video that
documented the highly individual style of <a href="#Romero/Galla_orillero">Victor
Romero and Norma Galla</a>.
<p>Bridge to the Tango was a leader in producing videos documenting individual
styles.
