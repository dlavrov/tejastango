<br>Bridge to the Tango Videos</h1>

Between 1996 and 2001, Daniel Trenner produced 72 instructional videos for his Bridge
to the Tango label.&nbsp; The videos cover his own teaching and dancing, Rebecca
Shulman's and that of a number of other masters from the older and younger
generations.

<p>An era came to an end on January 1, 2007 when all Bridge to the Tango instructional
videos were officially withdrawn from the market.&nbsp; Nonetheless, several vendors
seem have remaining copies of most of the Bridge to the Tango videos for sale in VHS
format.&nbsp; Among the possible sources are 
<a href="http://www.danieltrenner.com/" target="new">Daniel Trenner's webpage</a> 
and Phil Seyer's <a href="http://argentine-tango.com/" target="new">Argentine Tango
webpage</a>.  

<p>In late 2012, Daniel Trenner was in the process of releasing the material as video
downloads through his store.&nbsp; Daniel Trenner's Store disappeared for an extended
period of time.&nbsp; Rather than chase links while we are in the process of shutting
down Tango Argentino de Tejas, we simply dropped our Bridge to the Tango webpage.

<p>For information about Daniel Trenner and Bridge to Tango videos and downloads, see
<a href="http://www.danieltrenner.com/" target="new">Daniel Trenner's webpage</a>.

<p>For information about other instructional videos for Argentine tango, see our
webpage <a href="video_resources.html">Video Resources for the Tango Dancer</a>.
