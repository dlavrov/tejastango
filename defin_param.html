Stage performances of Argentine tango are typically choreographed, but as a social
dance, Argentine tango is highly improvisational. Drawing from their knowledge
of tango movements, dancers construct phrases of motion as they dance rather
than reproduce pre-set patterns. Improvisation allows the dancers to navigate
crowded dance floors, as well as to express themselves in a non-verbal
manner.

<p>Because it is an improvisational dance, Argentine tango does not have
any generally accepted or official syllabus to define its accepted vocabulary,
but it does have defining parameters. No specific set of steps, figures,
patterns, or structural elements define what Argentine tango is, although
they are useful pedagogic devices for learning to dance Argentine tango.

<p>In the absence of conventional definitions of tango dancing, a question
arises as to what defines what is and what is not accepted as Argentine
tango dancing. Louis Armstrong once said something like, "If you have to
ask what jazz is, you will never get it." For me, attempting to define
what is Argentine tango raises the same problems. I describe instead how
the defining parameters of tango are established and evolve.

<p>Argentine tango dancing has many similarities with jazz music in that
there are no institutionalized rules for its improvisation, but there are
common practices or idioms. Those who study jazz music or Argentine tango
dancing learn the respective idioms. In that sense, the common practices
become the parameters by which the art form is loosely defined by its practitioners.

<p>Trying to clearly delineate what is Argentine tango and what is not
is fraught with the same difficulties as trying to establish a clear definition
of jazz music. Like jazz music, dancing Argentine tango is an art form
that exists in a subculture, and as such, what defines its parameters or
limits is what is accepted by the subculture.&nbsp; That is, evolving social
custom determines which movements are considered part of the dance, and
which are not.

<p>Given what we have described for Argentine tango—a subculture with unwritten
standards of practice—an informal group of insiders, probably the best
dancers in the city most central to Argentine tango, Buenos Aires, are
likely to exert the greatest influence over what and what is not considered
Argentine tango. The standard for admission to this inner circle of influence
is the high respect of the other practitioners.

<p>Those who have not earned a position in the inner circle have substantially
less influence on the parameters, if any at all. For the majority of tango
dancers, conforming to the accepted practices laid down by one or more
of the masters will determine whether they are dancing Argentine tango
or doing something else. And perhaps surprisingly, these informal cultural
parameters of acceptance can often be more strictly enforced than written
laws enforced by police.

<p>None of this should be taken to mean that Argentine tango is a museum
piece or a cultural icon that is protected by an academy like the French
language. On the contrary, we are describing something that is accepted
as common usage in the subculture, where the usage evolves over time. Evolution
occurs as the subculture is changed by the deaths of insiders, the emergence
of new insiders, innovations by insiders, and influences from the outside.

<p>All of this said, the individuals most likely to influence the direction
of changes in Argentine tango dancing are those who have earned acceptance
in the inner circle by achieving sufficient mastery of the dance within
the existing, but implicit, parameters. Having achieved such status, they
are in the position to offer defining changes to the art form.

<p>Pablo Picasso mastered the existing art idioms before helping to introduce
modern art.&nbsp; Miles Davis and John Coltrane were well accepted as bebop
musicians before they helped to create modal jazz.&nbsp; Bob Dylan was
well accepted as a folk singer before he helped to create folk rock music.
Astor Piazzolla was well accepted as a tango musician before he helped
create tango nuevo. Juan Carlos Copes and Maria Nieves were well accepted
as outstanding dancers of Argentine tango before they helped to introduce
innovations into tango dancing.

<p>Despite their acceptance as masters of an existing genre, most individuals
who offer defining changes to their art form are seen as controversial
in their own time. Their works and motivations are carefully scrutinized—particularly
by those most attached to the previously established practices in the art
form. Despite their obvious dance skills, Gustavo Naveira, Fabian Salas,
and some others who worked with them have encountered much controversy
in offering a new style of tango.

<p>What about the innovations offered to Argentine tango dancers by those
outside the inner circle? In rare cases, where the ideas are quickly adopted
by a well-accepted insider, such ideas can affect the acceptability, and
perhaps simultaneously catapult an outsider into the inside circle. In
the vast majority of cases, however, the innovations offered by outsiders
will be rejected as inauthentic—that is, not conforming to the parameters
of Argentine Tango as defined by the subculture itself.
