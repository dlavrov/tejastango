<h2>
Argentine Tango Classes and Workshops</h2>
You don't need to go to Buenos Aires to learn to dance Argentine tango.&nbsp;
Florencia Taccetti is resident in Minneapolis/St. Paul Minnesota for much of
every year.&nbsp; With Florencia Taccetti in the Twin Cities, you just need
to come and play with the wonderful material that she teaches in her
classes.&nbsp; Of course there is so many other reasons to go to Buenos Aires
but if you want to learn Argentine tango, you have pretty much everything that
you need right here in the Midwest.&nbsp; Learn to dance Argentine tango at
home, and enjoy Buenos Aires when you visit.

<p>A native of Buenos Aires who is regarded as one of the premiere teachers
of Argentine tango, Florencia Taccetti has established a schedule of regular
classes and workshops in Minneapolis/St. Paul.&nbsp; Between her extensive
schedule of weekend workshops throughout North America, Florencia teaches
classes on Wednesday and Thursday nights in Minneapolis.&nbsp; While she is
resident in Minneapolis, Florencia also offers private lessons and unannounced
group classes, and she organizes workshops with top visiting instructors.

<p>During each winter, Florencia takes a lengthy break teaching regular classes
to return to Buenos Aires and recharge her porte&ntilde;a soul.&nbsp; While in
Buenos Aires, Florencia dances in the milongas and works with some of her
long-time friends, such as Gustavo Naveira.&nbsp; Florencia finds her returns
to Buenos Aires inspiring, and she returns to Minneapolis/St. Paul ready to give
the best of her porte&ntilde;a experience to taking her classes.&nbsp; Florencia
is back in the Twin Cities, teaching classes and organizing workshops.

<p><b>Florencia's comments:</b>
<br>Explore the beauty of the two bodies working together, listening to each other
as you share the emotions coming out from the music.&nbsp; It is like tossing with
a cup full of tenderness, sensuality and grace.&nbsp; This is a nice series of
classes to work on listening to each other, changing the dynamic between legatos
and rhythm, how to slow down your dance and build energy for the next move, and
how to brake with some very subtle embellishments on the rhythm.&nbsp; Find how
to be light and suspended on the dance by finding a very solid embrace.&nbsp;
Work with many beautiful elements to be sensitive and simple in your tango.&nbsp;
Use turns, line boleos, circular boleos, ocho cortados, etc.

<p><b>Florencia's Notes:</b>
<ul>
<li>
Classes are open to anyone in the community—even if you haven't been in
Florenica's classes before.</li>
<li>
Remember it is not Florencia, but your presence that makes the class fun.&nbsp;
Come and share your love of tango and beautiful spirit with everyone
else in class!!!</li>
<li>
Instruction will start promptly at 8:15 p.m., so plan to arrive at 8:00
p.m. for registration and warm up.&nbsp; The warm-up time is particularly
necessary because you don't practice every day as we do in Argentina.</li>
<li>
All of Florencia's classes are open to women who want to lead as well
as men who want to follow.&nbsp; The only requirement is that you bring
a partner of your own size and weight so you don't hurt yourself or your
partner.</li>
<li>
Florencia's Wednesday classes are open to intermediate tango dancers.&nbsp;
Those with less experience, should start with her Thursday night
<a href="#thursday">beginning classes.</a></li>
<li>
Confirm your attendance for the class in advance, so that Florencia can
maintain a good gender balance in the class.</li>
</ul>

<p>Intermediate classes are typically taught in a series with new topics
introduced about every 4-6 weeks.

<p><b>Florencia's comments:</b>
<br>This is the important class to have an easy, fun and successful start
in tango.

<p><b>Florencia's Notes:</b>
<ul>
<li>
Classes are open to anyone in the community—even if you haven't been in
Florenica's classes before.</li>
<li>
Remember it is not Florencia, but your presence that makes the class fun.&nbsp;
Come and share your love of tango and beautiful spirit with everyone

<li>
Instruction will start promptly at 8:00 p.m., so plan to arrive at 7:45
p.m. for registration and warm up.&nbsp; The warm-up time is particularly
necessary because you don't practice every day as we do in Argentina.&nbsp;
So, at least you can give yourself those 15 minutes of practice before class
to be attuned with your brain, body and soul at the moment you are to start
assimilating information from the class; OK?&nbsp; Life is rushing us all
the time, but at least do the best you can to be on time and give yourself
and your partner the opportunity to connect peacefully with each other in
those 15 minutes.</li>
<li>
The beginning class is best for newcomers to tango.&nbsp; It is also a good
class for dancers who wish to switch roles—if they come with a partner of
the same gender.</li>
<li>
Newcomers please take it easy while learning elements like these because
the body needs time to develop skills that move beyond what the mind
understands.&nbsp; As the body learns, the movements become beautiful and
fluid.&nbsp; It may take more than one series on these elements, so give
yourself time to learn and you'll get there.
<li>
All of Florencia's classes are open to women who want to lead as well
as men who want to follow.&nbsp; The only requirement is that you bring
a partner of your own size and weight so you don't hurt yourself or your

<h2>
<a NAME="private"></a>Florencia's Private Lessons:</h2>

The space for a private lesson is the space to share with your teacher
all your intimate questions about the dance, to express all your concerns
about everything that is needed to be taken care of inside a safe
environment and contained by the compassionate and helpful vision of the
teacher.

<p>You may be concerned about technique, execution of certain steps,
miscommunication with a partner, musicality, style, or anything that you
feel are places where you would like to spend more time and experience
more intensively than what you do in a group class.

<p>A private lesson can be about any topic where you notice yourself weaker
or not secure enough in your dance and you need to clear doubts.&nbsp; It is
very common in the process of learning tango that people get confused and
frustrated, and find the feedback from the practice partner is no longer
helpful.

<p>It is in moments like these when the teacher's advice can be very soothing and
supportive.

<p>The background of the teacher is important, of course, but more important is
the teacher's talent to see what the student needs the most at each particular
moment.&nbsp; Those needs are always different with each student.&nbsp; There
is no formula that works for everybody.&nbsp; A teacher with enough experience
may be able to unlock places where we all get stock when we are learning something
very new an different for our bodies and souls.

<p>It is also necessary to help with the cultural breakthrough that happens with
everybody who decides to go deeper to learn this dance and many other disciplines
too.&nbsp; It is important to welcome that moment and to breathe the transitions
so you can allow transformation to happen.

<p>In Florencia's case, she uses a number of of precious tools that she learned through
her life as a dancer and a personal researcher that helped her expand her consciousness
about tango and herself.&nbsp; Her experience includes many years of tango, ballet,
modern dance, dance anatomy, Laban/Bartenieff movement analysis, eutonia, Iyengar Yoga,
Zen and chanting meditation.&nbsp; She also has to thank many years of body pain and
cancer experience that guided her to the new self she is today. 

<p>Florencia's fee for a private lesson in the United States is $100 for an hour plus
the studio fee.&nbsp; Special packages are available for students in the Twin Cities
and nearby communities that maintain continuity with Florencia's group classes.

<p>A partner is preferable for private lessons.&nbsp; Florencia also offers semi-private
lessons for groups that organize themselves.

<h2>
Florencia's Book Recommendation:</h2>
Florencia recommends buying and reading, Mauricio Castro's book,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tango-Structure-Dance-Castro-Mauricio/dp/9505261292/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1270574844&sr=8-2" target="new"><i>Tango:
The Structure of the Dance</i></a>.&nbsp; According to Florencia, mastering the material
in Mauricio's book will end the vicious circle of taking classes with many different teachers
and learning nothing.&nbsp;  The book conveys a deep understanding of the dance's structure,
which enables you to create your own dance improvisationally without depending on memorized
patterns.&nbsp; Florencia says the graphics in Mauricio's book are challenging and require
patience, but the system is very well explained, and her classes will help
translate what's in the book into knowledge in each dancer's body.
