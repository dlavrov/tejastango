<br>A brief guide to some neo-tango CDs for the DJ playing music for tango dancers
who would enjoy dancing to something new and different.
</div>

<p>Until the past few years, nearly all of the music played at milongas
was taken from recordings made by the golden age orchestras.&nbsp; In addition,
many contemporary tango orchestras have filled out their repetoire with
compositions from the golden era.&nbsp; In the 21st century, however, we
have different social venues, newer technologies, some different musical
instruments, and continuing musical evolution.&nbsp; All of these developments
have inspired some of today's musicians to develop new approaches to tango.&nbsp;
At the same time, dancers are looking for new expression.
<p>At some of the milongas in Buenos Aires, Europe and North America, the
DJs have added neo-tango music to their playlists of traditional tango
music.&nbsp; Neo-tango consists of two genres of music: tango-fusion and
"alternative" tango music.&nbsp; Tango fusion integerates traditional tango
rhythms and instrumentation with other musical traditions, contemporary
instruments and electronica to create a modern and culturally relevant
world tango music with a dance-club sound.&nbsp; Some of the better-known
tango-fusion artists are Gotan Project, Bajofondo Tango Club, and Carlos
Libedinsky.&nbsp; Alternative tango music is tango music from other traditions
or non-tango music that some dancers find interesting for dancing Argentine
tango steps.

<h3>
<a NAME="recordings"></a>Some Tango-Fusion Recordings</h3>
Carlos Libedinsky — Narcotango
<br>Of the currently available tango-fusion recordings, my friend Brian
Dunn of Boulder, Colorado points out that Libedinsky's <i>Narcotango</i>
has the strongest tango sensibilities.&nbsp; Afficionados of tango fusion
are likely to find all the tracks on <i>Narcotango</i> to be suitable for
social dancing, but "Vi Luz y Subi" and "Otra Luna" are beautiful and have
the strongest tango sound.&nbsp; "Plano Sequenco" and "Trancetango" also
work fairly well, but the underlying tango sound is a little farther down
in the mix.
<p>Gotan Project — La Revancha del Tango
<br>This ensemble integrates Argentine tango with a Parisian house-music
sensibility to create a sound that was fresh if played sufficiently sparingly.&nbsp;
Once regarded as containing the best tango-fusion music available, the
CD was played frequently at many milongas, and some dancers have grown
tired of it.&nbsp; Less traditionally minded dancers regard all the tracks
to be suitable for dancing, but "Queremos Paz," "Una Musica Brutal" and
"Epoca" stand out as the best.
<p>Gotan Project Remixed
<br>The remix may be the answer for those who have grown tired of the original
Gotan Project release.&nbsp; For this project, some of the tracks from
previous album were radically remixed and some new remixes have been added.&nbsp;
The new tracks have been repackaged with <i>La Revancha del Tango</i> as
a 'bonus' disk.
<p>Gotan Project — Inspiracion-Expiracion
<br>A disappointment after such a long wait for a new CD from Gotan Project,
<i>Inspiracion-Expiracion</i>
is no more than a dj remix that uses previously released Gotan Project
tracks and tracks by non-tango artists.&nbsp; Not much is of interest for
tango dancing.
<p>Gotan Project — Lunatico
<br>A new effort that succeeds better than Inspiracion-Expiracion, but
the sound is no longer as revolutionary as when the first Gotan Project
CD was released.
<p>Bajofondo Tango Club
<br>This Argentine/Uruguayan ensemble plays dance-club music with some
tango rhythm.&nbsp; The combination does more to freshen the dance club
sound than it does to freshen tango.&nbsp; Less traditionally minded dancers
consider all of the tracks suitable for dancing Argentine tango, but "En
Mi/Soloedad" stands out as the having the strongest tango sound.&nbsp;
"Naranjo en Flor" also works fairly well as a slow milonga, but I prefer
the remixed version found on the <i>Le&ccedil;ons de Tango</i> CD.&nbsp;
On the other pieces, many dancers might find that the dance-club layers
are too strong.
<p>Bajofondo Tango Club — Supervielle
<br>With their second release, Bajofondo creates a more sophisticated downtempo/lounge
sound.&nbsp; A few tracks are remixes of the old with completely new elements
including hip hop and milonga.&nbsp; "Perfume," "Pulso," "Air Concret"
and "Centroja" are among my favorite tracks for tango dancing.&nbsp; On
his now defunct Tangonauts webpage, Santiago Steele recommended "Decollage,"
"Perfume (Remix)," "Leonel," "El Feo" and "Tangodrome" as the best tracks.&nbsp;
Combined, the two lists suggest a disc with a lot of good material.
<p>Electrocutango — Felino
<br>Norwegian composer Sverre Indris Joner has assembled a collection of
original electronic music and has remixes some old tango.&nbsp; For dancing,
the most interesting track is "Felino."
<p>Carla Pugliese — Ojos Verdes Cerrados
<br>Osvaldo Pugliese's granddaughter leads a tango orchestra that adds
a layer of keyboard electronica.&nbsp; Some find the overall effect more
tango than tango-fusion.&nbsp; The standout track is Ostinato.
<p>Otros Aires — Otros Aires
<br>Some original compositions and classic tangos and milongas that have
been layered with non-traditional elements and electronica.&nbsp; Many
of the tracks work well, but sound very much like each other.&nbsp; Milonga
Sentimental is the stand out track.
<p>Tanghetto — Emigrante
<br>Emmigrante adds a nocturnal jazz/lounge element to the club-tango sound
of Bajofondo.&nbsp; The tracks all sound similar and only a few work well
for tango dancing.&nbsp; "Una Llamada" and "Inmigrante" are strong enough
to make the CD essential for most DJs or anyone else building a collection
of tango-fusion music.
<p>Hybrid Tango — Hybrid Tango
<br>Hybrid Tango mixes bandoneon, piano and spanish guitar with a driving
electronic beat to create a sound similar to Tangoghetto and Bajofondo.&nbsp;
The best track is "M&aacute;s De Lo Mismo."
<p>Le&ccedil;ons de Tango by Aubade
<br>This CD, issued by the French lingerie company Aubade,&nbsp; is collection
of tango-fusion tracks from <i>Astor Piazzolla Remixed</i>, new remixes
of tracks from <i>Bajofondo Tango Club</i> and unadorned tangos by performers
such as El Arranque, Roberto Goyeneche and Astor Piazzolla.&nbsp; Of particular
interest are "El Tango" and "Naranjo en Flor."
<p>Tango Project (Jaime Wilensky) — Volume II New Tango
<br>Wilensky combines electronica with tango to create music that covers
the ground from tango to lounge to elevator music.&nbsp; On this release,
my favorite tracks are "Sentimientos" and "Buddy."&nbsp; Some of the tracks
have been released on other Wilensky CDs.
<p>Astor Piazzolla Remixed
<br>Inspired by the success of the Gotan Project, the tracks on this CD
overdub club-style electronica on original tracks of Piazzolla's fusion
of tango, jazz and classical music.&nbsp; Although interesting conceptually,
the result isn't inspiring for tango dancing — perhaps because the music
lacks strong tango dance rhythms.&nbsp; As is the case for much of Piazzolla's
recordings, the underlying tango music lacks strong dance rhythms, and the
layer of electronica doesn't add tango rhythms.&nbsp; "El Tango" and "Luna"
work the best.
<p>Electronic Tango
<br>The music on this CD is a departure from dance-club sensibilities of
Gotan Project and Bajofondo toward the avant garde electronica of groups
like Amon Tobin and Aphex Twin.&nbsp; The music on the CD is quite difficult
for dancing, but it is tango with a new sound.&nbsp; The most interesting
tracks are "Torpedo" by Appart, "Tango" by Ruben Steiner and "Libertango"
by Zumo Real.
<p>Astornautas — Ultratango
<br>Not much stands out on this electronica meets Piazzolla CD.&nbsp; I
like "CiteTango," and it seems to work well at milongas.
<p>Juan Carlos Caceres — Toca Tango
<br>Juan Carlos Caceres has a wonderful, deep singing voice and plays piano
with jazz voicings and a perfect rhythmic touch.&nbsp; He is recorded here
with a decidedly non-traditional ensemble, but little of the electronica
that is found on most tango-fusion recordings.&nbsp; The result is tango
and candombes that have overtones of cabaret, jazz, dance club and theatrical
music.&nbsp; The tangos are decidedly slow, but a few of them may be the
perfect change of pace late at night.&nbsp; Two of the candombes—"Tango
Negro" and "Toca Tango"—are absolutely stunning.
<p>Moulin Rouge (Soundtrack)
<br>The movie spectacular Moulin Rouge contains one tango, "El Tango de
Roxanne" which some dancers may find fun for dancing on occasion.&nbsp;
Recorded for the movie, this tango combines the rock classic "Roxanne"
with a tango written by Mariano Mores.
