<p><a NAME="0015"></a><b><font size=+1>On Differing Styles and Overtraining</font></b>
<br>17 November 2006 — Stephen Brown
<p>On <a href="http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2006/msg03311.html" target="new">Tango-L</a>,
Meredith Klein writes about her recent observations in Buenos Aires:
<br>"[I]n the [traditional] milongas (Club Gricel, Nino Bien, Salon Canning,
Confiteria Ideal) ..., it's not appropriate to dance in open embrace or
to throw ganchos or boleos.&nbsp; In these milongas, people dance in close
embrace, use fairly simple steps, and prioritize the flow of the entire
dance floor. ... However, there is another set of milongas and practicas
in Buenos Aires where different rules apply.&nbsp; At Villa Malcolm, Practica
X, Soho Tango, La Viruta, La Marshall, and many more, the dancers are younger
(mostly between 18 and 40) and get bored if they have to dance in close
embrace all night, doing simple steps.&nbsp; They are always pushing themselves
and both competing and collaborating with each other to find new possibilities
in tango.&nbsp; This includes creating new kinds of movements, finding
new ways to put familiar movements together, and exploring new ways to
interpret traditional tango music (usually at least 80% of the music played
in these milongas is golden age, just like at the traditional milongas)."
<p>For more information about the latter scene, see Andr&eacute;s Amarilla's
<a href="http://www.andresamarilla.com/theguide.htm" target="new">The Guide:
Nuevo Tango in BA</a>.
<p>What happens when the young dancers change venues?
<p>Meredith continues:
<br>"Argentines and foreigners who know the milonga scene in Buenos Aires
are very sensitive to and respectful of the rules that apply in each venue.&nbsp;
On Monday nights, the practica at Villa Malcolm ends earlier than on other
nights, so afterwards dozens of dancers head over to Salon Canning several
blocks away.&nbsp; When they arrive, you wouldn't know that they were the
same dancers.&nbsp; The women who were wearing dance sneakers at Malcolm
are now in Comme Il Fauts, and perhaps they even put on makeup and changed
their clothes to better fit into the milonga environment.&nbsp; People
who were practicing jumps, 360-degree underarm turns and colgadas at Malcolm
are now sedately and happily executing their ocho cortados.&nbsp; Perhaps
at 5:30 am, they'll start tearing up the floor again, but by then pretty
much everyone has gone home and no one cares."
<p>On <a href="http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2006/msg03316.html" target="new">Tango-L</a>,
the always insightful <a href="http://www.danceoftheheart.com/" target="new">Brian
Dunn</a> adds a wonderful dimension to Meredith's observations:
<br>"Last night, I was watching the 'midnight transition' between El Motivo/Villa
Malcolm and Canning that you describe here, and another thought struck
me.&nbsp; These young dancers dance the small compact 'Nino Bien' stuff
exquisitely!&nbsp; Superb musicality, delicate intricate footwork, tiny
tiny little flicks of heel, toe and ankle, just a delight to watch."
<p>"Then I realized that by pushing themselves and each other in friendly
competition at high-energy go-for-broke practicas, they are also 'overtraining'
their navigation and musicality skills under these high-energy conditions,
which tends to make them very expressive and solid partners when crowded
floors require them to reduce the scale of their movements.
<p>"This overtraining principle is exploited in many kinds of sports and
performance training settings. ... By pushing their edge in the 'tango
workout' practicas, the low-stress 'Nino Bien dancing' of these young dancers
is well within their 'performance envelope,' rather than being closer to
the maximum they are used to.&nbsp; This leaves a lot more available brain
power (and heart power) for musicality and connection.
<p>"To achieve the same end, regardless of one's stylistic preferences
in social tango, any tango dancer who values floorcraft, connection and
musicality in milonga settings (as I do) might want to consider overtraining
their floorcraft and movement dynamics with higher-energy "big tango" practica
work."

<p><a NAME="0014"></a><b><font size=+1>Changes in the Tango Scene</font></b>
<br>9 November 2006 — Stephen Brown
<p>On his <a href="http://totango.net/ttindex.html" target="new">ToTango</a>
webpage, Keith Elshaw recently offered the following comments about changes
in the tango scene:
<br>"Three big changes I have been noting for a while are currently cresting:
<p>"1 - More awareness of social dancing imperatives as opposed to learning
from/wannabe stage dancing on the intermediate level."
<p>"2 - More 'Nuevo' devotees only wanting to learn stage-type dancing
and not giving a hoot about social dancing and/or getting along on the
floor."
<p>"I see lots of both types. They are carving out their places in the
spectrum and resultant divisions are affecting business patterns in the
world of running milongas."
<p>"3 - Social dancers are getting really hot for Canyengue. This is sparking
a whole new interest in the oldest of the recorded orchestras and classes
in the old style dancing."
<p>In thinking about how this affects the music choices, Keith adds:
<br>"I perceive a wave of new interest in Canaro, Lomuto, Donato and Orquesta
Tipica Victor, for instance. Right now, if you are a dj, you darn well
better have a good version of Canaro's Poema ready to go. It is a "new"
hit.&nbsp; Just like Donato's "Ella Es As&iacute; has been for 3 years
now.&nbsp; Oh, dear ... the Nuevo people don't want to go in this direction
at all. They are asking for electronica and such."

Discontinued</font></b>
<br>6 November 2006 — Stephen Brown
<p>An era will come to an on January 1, 2007 when all Bridge to the Tango
instructional videos will be withdrawn from the market.&nbsp; Between 1996
and 2001, Daniel Trenner produced 72 instructional videos for his Bridge
to the Tango label.&nbsp; The videos cover his own teaching and dancing,
Rebecca Shulman's and that of a number of other masters from the older
and younger generations.
<p>Some of the titles may become available in DVD format in the future,
but that will involve complex negotiations in Argentina involving the the
rights to the video images and the music used in the videos.&nbsp; Some
of videos—including those with Daniel, Rebecca and the earliest recorded
in the masters' series—will never be available again because the original
video production was not suitable for conversion to DVD.
<p><a href="http://www.thetangocatalogue.com/" target="new">The Tango Catalogue</a>,
which has been the exclusive distributor of these videos, is closing out
its <a href="http://www.danieltrenner.com/video/video.lasso" target="new">Bridge

2006.&nbsp; Quantity and wholesale discounts are also available.

<p><a NAME="0012"></a><b><font size=+1>What the Bleep Is Tango?</font></b>
<br>9 October 2006 — Stephen Brown
<p>The great tango composer Enrique Santos Discepolo called tango "a sad
thought that is danced."&nbsp; Some people hear lonliness in tango.&nbsp;
For some people, tango is a shared intimacy.&nbsp; For others, tango is
sex on legs or the vertical expression of horizontal desire.&nbsp; In many
communities, tango seems to be synonomous with anger.
<p>For me, tango is all of these emotions and none of them.&nbsp; Tango
connects deeply and opens the holes in our hearts that we were taught to
be scared of, and whatever emotions we have stuffed into plug those holes
is what pours out of us.&nbsp; On those lucky occasions when tango empties
out those holes and we are able to get past our emotional considerations,
we know real joy and a still mind.

Sergio Vandekier writes:
<br>"Argentine culture has developed different styles of Tango (traditional,
open, close, embrace, milonguero, nuevo, canyengue, etc).&nbsp; They all
have a common vocabulary of movements and expression in the way they are
danced with some changes in technique and embrace but all those styles
belong to the same generic dance.&nbsp; They overlap in this regard and
they are characterized by improvisation. ...
<p>"Tango has followed in its form and content every change in Argentine
evolution, the dance as well as the music and the lyrics. ...
<p>"Foreign personal styles and gender roles may leave authenticity behind.
This means that when you dissociate a tango style from its native culture
it loses its pristine form and content and could become something else.
<p>"[T]his does not mean that a tango that lost authenticity is a bad tango,

in Argentine Tango</font></b>
<br>16 June 2006 — Stephen Brown
<p>The dancer who wants to own tango cannot rely purely on instruction.&nbsp;
The dancer who is seeking self expression and freedom in their own dancing
needs to look past the limitations that are inherent in any pedagogy.&nbsp;
In that regard, good teaching facilitates self-discovery and self-learning.&nbsp;
Perhaps taking such a philosophy to an extreme in the few lessons and classes
that he taught, jazz pianist Bill Evans refused to show his students the
chord voicings and progressions for which he was renown because he did
not want to deprive them of the opportunity to discover the knowledge on
their own.

George and Jairelbhi Furlong have the following story:
<p>There was a master swordsman who had a student that could mimick all
of his moves perfectly.&nbsp; The student off course, was proud of his
accomplishment.
<p>After years of study, the master told the student, "Go and practice
everything I have taught you, and do not come back for three years!"
<p>The student did as the master said and returned after three years: "Master,
I am frustrated.&nbsp; I practiced everything as you taught me, and a third
of the form does not feel like what you showed me."
<p>"No good," the master says, "Leave again and do not come back for another
three years!"
<p>Once again the students leaves and practices continously for three years.&nbsp;
After that time he seeks out his master:&nbsp; "Master, I do not understand.&nbsp;
I feel that I am getting worse!&nbsp; Two thirds of the form feels different
from what you taught me!"
<p>"No good!" the master says, "Leave and do not come back for another
three years!"
<p>For the third time the student leaves and for the third time after practicing
for three years, returns to his master: "Master, I have failed.&nbsp; Everything
you have taught me is gone.&nbsp; The form feels nothing like what you
showed me."
<p>The master smiles at his student, "Good, now the form is no longer mine,
but your own!"
