<br>30 December 2005 — Stephen Brown
<p>The interactions between disagreeable (but sometimes loveable) people
is a very common way of creating drama and comedy on television.&nbsp;
Are disagreeable people really entertaining?&nbsp; The secret of television
is in keeping disagreeable people a passive form of entertainment rather
than an particiapatory form of entertainment.&nbsp; Maybe we can do the
same in our every day lives.
<p>Does that suggest that watching television is good preparation for every
day life?&nbsp; Such a thought probably takes the idea too far.&nbsp; For
one thing, television oversimplifies complex human interaction.

<br>21 November 2005 — Stephen Brown
<p>Argentine Tango not only keeps the aging body in shape, it may also
help sharpen the aging brain more than simple exercise, according to a
recent study.&nbsp; The study, presented by Patrica McKinely at the annual
meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, adds to a growing body of evidence
that finds challenging leisure activities may offer a boost in brainpower
that could offset the declines that can come with old age.&nbsp; Previous
studies had shown that exercise improves brain function, but tango proved
to do more.
<p>For the study, McKinley and her team recruited 30 seniors ages 68 to
91.&nbsp; Half the group got tango lessons, and the other half were assigned
to a walking group.&nbsp; After 10 weeks, the team found that both walkers
and dancers had improved memory scores.&nbsp; The tango group also showed
improved balance, posture and motor coordination, as well as cognitive
gains.&nbsp; These skills are useful in dancing and other aspects of everyday
life.

It's not just some initial inspiration; the intricacies and interplay within

just using the music as a background to your movement, or a structure to
embellish on.&nbsp; You are responding to the music, becoming involved
in the music, making choices every second about which parts of the music
you wish to highlight or play down or even contradict.&nbsp; Sometimes
it is as if your feet or your heart or the movement of your body becomes
another instrument, adding a little more music.&nbsp; Perhaps another rhythm
with the feet, perhaps a deepening of the sweetness of the melody with
the way you move your leg or torso...
<p>"As a dancer, I am answering and expanding the music into the spatial

<br>"The reason the classics are classics is because they have a depth
and complexity such that the more that you listen and play with the music,
the more you find in it.&nbsp; Someone recently mentioned to me that after
a while you have all the music memorized, but I don't actually find that
is so.&nbsp; About three years ago I was sure that I had that classic early
instrumental D'Arienzo stuff down cold, at least the ones that were in
heavy rotation where I dance.&nbsp; Then I danced with some visitor from
out of town and realized I had so much to learn; he was dancing to things
in the music I had never thought to listen for.&nbsp; Since then, I've
found more and more and more in those same D'Arienzo tunes that I used
to think I had down cold, and I am not sure any more that I will ever come
to the end of it.
<p>"Because if I ever finally do get the whole entire thing memorized,
every rhythm of every instrument, each pause and syncopation and change
in mood, intensity, instrumental balance etc., well, even then, I'll have
lots of time to get creative with which aspects I wish to highlight at
this particular moment of this particular dance with this particular person.
I'm not just talking about highlighting rhythmically, but with the density/lightness
of my movement, the dynamics of entering or leaving each weight change.&nbsp;
So, in effect, I can become one or two new instruments in the music, and
for that moment in time and that particular partner, I can create a new
music that has never been experienced before and will never be experienced

<br>"Argentine Tango is by all accounts a complex dance that defies definition.&nbsp;
Tango practicioners may spend years studying it and mastering the vocabulary
of the dance only to discover new possibilities at every turn.&nbsp; There
are so many variables involved—music, steps, skills, etc.—that from the
surface it seems as if the Tango indeed is an 'infinite possibility.'&nbsp;
Yet, we are always striving to preserve it; to be true to its traditions
and accepted principles.&nbsp; This presents an interesting problem.&nbsp;
For Argentine Tango to remain an infinite possibility it must change.&nbsp;
But if it changes then, what are we preserving?
<p>"Complex systems show certain common behaviors.&nbsp; We can think of
those behaviors as characteristics of complex systems.&nbsp; One would
think that by studying those characteristics we could eventually understand
and master the system.&nbsp; Alas, the time honored scientific approach
of reductionism—taking the thing apart into its smallest components to
see how it works—doesn't work with complex systems because the interesting
behavior seems to arise from the spontaneous interaction of the components.&nbsp;
Argentine Tango is a product of music, dance steps, skill, history, and
culture.&nbsp; Any single one of these components leads to a different
field of study.&nbsp; The Argentine Tango dance arises only when you combine
all of them.
<p>"The answer to the question: is Argentine Tango changing? is in my opinion
a resounding yes.&nbsp; All of its components continue to change individually.&nbsp;
And that is precisely how it should be for AT to remain alive.&nbsp; Complex
systems seem to strike a balance between the need for order and the imperative
to change.&nbsp; Complex systems tend to locate themselves at a place called
'the edge of chaos.'&nbsp; This is a place where there is enough innovation
to keep the system vibrant, and enough stability to keep it from collapsing
into anarchy.&nbsp; It is a zone of conflict and upheaval, where the old
and the new are constantly at war.
<p>"Finding the balance point is a delicate matter—if a complex system
drifts too close it risks falling over into incoherence and dissolution;
but if the system moves too far away from the edge, it becomes rigid, frozen,
totalitarian.&nbsp; Both conditions lead to extinction.&nbsp; Too much
change is as destructive as too little.&nbsp; Only at the edge of chaos
can complex systems flourish.&nbsp; This place, I believe, is where we
find the Argentine Tango."

<p><a NAME="0029"></a><b><font size=+1>Developing Skills for Social Dancing</font></b>
<br>12 August 2005 — Stephen Brown
<p>I someitmes wonder how much the differing perspectives on what succeeds
as instruction for social dancing is the result of masters from one culture
teaching beginners from another.&nbsp; Such a relationship is bound to
lead to very different expectations on the two sides.
<p>Many beginners take up tango as a diversion from their daily lives.&nbsp;
If they are taught in step patterns, they don't know enough to get inside
the big figures and take them apart and make them their own.&nbsp; They
simply collect step patterns thinking that they are learning to dance tango.&nbsp;
They are also unlikely to know enough to ask the instructor to teach tango
as small elements or in any other way that might facilitate a quicker mastery
of rudimentary social dance skills.&nbsp; Moreover, if they were attracted
by a tango show, such as <i>Forever Tango</i> or <i>Boccatango</i>, they
may want to be taught those steamy stage moves without realizing that social
tango is somewhat different.
<p>If beginners are taught tango in small elements and are told that they
are learning the only authentic way of social dancing, they are unlikely
to realize that other approaches may develop a better sense of how to put
the elements together in an interesting way.&nbsp; If they are taught tango
in a structural framework, they are unlikely to know that other approaches
may help develop form and the ability to dance in the available space to
the rhythm of the music.
<p>At the same time, the big-name instructors would be shocked to learn
that they have been brought to town to teach people who haven't a clue
about tango and may never develop a clue.&nbsp; The big-name instructors
got inside tango themselves and made it their own—likely without formal
instruction or with instruction that was limited to a single approach.&nbsp;
It doesn't likely occur to them that it might be easier for the students
to learn tango through combined teaching methods&nbsp; If it did occur
to them, they might consider such instruction as depriving the student
the opportunity of finding their own insights in tango and compromising
the quality of what they are teaching.
<p>If North Americans are to dance Argentine tango socially with some semblance
of authenticity or skill (as defined by the way tango is danced socially
in Buenos Aires), they must either find their own insights and overcome
the limited perspective of a single approach to teaching, find an instructor
who can offer a variety of approaches to learning tango, or work with several
instructors, each of whom has a different approach to learning tango.&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="0028"></a><b><font size=+1>On Style and Styles (4)</font></b>
<br>12 August 2005 — Stephen Brown
<p>In some ways, tango has divided into three stylistic camps.&nbsp; (See
<a href="inside_2004archive.html#0007">Taking
Tango Styles to Extremes</a>.)&nbsp; The milonguero-style dancers maintain
that their style is the only authentic form of social dancing, and other
teachers are teaching what amounts to stage tango.&nbsp; The salon-style
dancers claim that their style is danced and taught by the best of the
big-name dancers.&nbsp; The nuevo-style dancers claims that their style
is the direction in which tango is evolving.
<p>Yet across these styles, bigger differences are found in the methods
of teaching and in the ways beginners dance than in those who have developed
mastery.&nbsp; The first group emphasizes small elements, and the beginners
plod along to the music without much quality of movement, sense of form
or inventiveness.&nbsp; The second emphasizes step patterns, and the beginners
attempt to execute complex step patterns without regard to the music or
the ronda.&nbsp; The third emphasizes the underlying structure of tango,
and the beginners spin wildly across the dance floor without seeming regard
for others.&nbsp; In examining the pathologies of how the beginners in
each group dance, we frequently mistake the shortcomings of the instructional
methods for the characteristics of each style of dance.
<p>With persistent work, many people break through the limitations of the
method by which they learned tango, but I think it is much easier to develop
a well-rounded mastery by pursuing all three methods of learning.&nbsp;
Only local teachers can develop a consistent program of teaching that embraces
all three approaches to learning.&nbsp; Absent such programs, dancers must
find their own insights or work with several instructors.

<p>On <a href="http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2005/msg02104.html" target="new">Tango-L</a>,
Sergio Vandekier distinguishes between the salon and nuevo styles as they
are danced well and are danced poorly:
<br>"The problem with using Salon open embrace or Nuevo as a social dance
form comes from ignorance and lack of skills."
<p>The source of that ignorance and lack of skill is likely the result
of teaching that conveys tango as complex step patterns executed in an
open embrace while 1950s Di Sarli instrumentals or frilly unrhythmic tangos
play in the background.&nbsp; In Buenos Aires, tango is so ingrained in
the culture that porte&ntilde;os come to the tango with an implicit knowledge
of its essential elements.&nbsp; For them, instruction in steps and figures
may be sufficient to develop the ability to dance tango with skill.
<p>Those of us who learn tango outside its cultural frame of reference
are dependent upon our instructors to a degree that is unfathomable to
most Argentines, including those Argentines who regularly teach tango to
foreigners.&nbsp; The genius of those who originated the teaching of milonguero-style
tango was to recognize and create a pedagogy that compensated for that
dependence.&nbsp; By teaching tango as small rhythmic elements, the milonguero-style
instructors succeeded in developing the social dance skills of their students.
<p>In the bargain, the milonguero-style instructors packaged a largely
personal style of tango with their pedagogy.&nbsp; Fortunately, a particular
style of tango is not essential to the pedagogy.&nbsp; Adapting the pedagogy
to the teaching of other styles or that is independent of style is completely
possible.

<p>There has been continuing controversy over the various styles of dancing
tango, principally between milonguero, salon and nuevo.&nbsp; (See <a href="http://www.tejastango.com/inside_2004archive.html#0007">Taking
Tango Styles to Extremes</a>.)&nbsp; Interestingly enough, some of the
controversy over tango styles has been in confusing instructional methods
with the characteristics of the dance styles themselves.
<p>The development of navigational and rhythmic skills is is facilitated
by teaching tango as small rhythmic elements.&nbsp; In addition, a close
embrace, a good connection, rhythmic movement and good navigation are the
characteristics of skillful social dancing.
<p>The genius of milonguero-style teaching has been in conveying tango
as small rhythmic elements that are executed in a close embrace.&nbsp;
Consequently, teaching in this style facilitates the development of skills
that are useful for social dancing.
<p>In contrast, much of the teaching of salon-style tango relies on complex
step patterns executed in a open embrace while 1950s Di Sarli instrumentals
or frilly unrhythmic tangos play in the background.&nbsp; Such an approach
doesn't faciliate the development of skills that are useful for social
dancing.&nbsp; Salon-style tango itself is not characterized by an open
embrace nor the execution of complex patterns without regard to the music,
but the most commonly used instructional methods misrepresent it as so.&nbsp;
If salon-style instructors are going to succeed in preparing dancers with
skills for dancing socially, they must learn to teach tango as small rhythmic
elements in a close, but flexible embrace.
<p>My preference would be that instructors learn to teach tango independently
of any particular style, and that style remain an individual choice.

<br>"I have asked probably 100 men in Bueno Aires what they call their
style and you know what they answer?&nbsp; They say, 'Es el mio' (It is
mine).&nbsp; Or, they might say, 'Es de mi padre/barrio/liso/simple,' but
they never say 'close-embrace milonguero style.'"
<p>Jazz pianist Bill Evans offered the following comments about teaching
and learning style:
<br>"When you begin to teach jazz, the most dangerous thing is that you
tend to teach style. ... [I]f you are going to try to teach jazz ... you
must abstract the principles of music that have nothing to do with style,
and this is exceedingly difficult. ... It ends up where the jazz player,
ultimately, if he is going to be a serious jazz player, teaches himself."
<p>Of course, tango is not jazz, but at some point anyone who is going
to become a tango dancer must take responsibility for their own dancing.&nbsp;
Teachers can facilitate that independent self discovery by teaching tango
skills that stand independently of a specific style and by providing an
encouragement for dancers to find and develop their own styles.

Sergio Vandekier responds to <a href="#0021">Hyla Dickinson's comments</a>:
<p>"A [man imposing himself on a woman is a] problem that should not exist
if the milonga codes were to be followed.&nbsp; People, or most people
in Argentina go to the milonga not to socialize, not to drink, not to pick
up women, but to dance, just to dance tango.&nbsp; The transient relationship
between a man and a woman is one of mutual respect.
<p>"The woman and the man surrender to each other because they&nbsp; know
beforehand that as soon as the music stops everything returns to normal,
there are no consequences of that moment of intimacy.&nbsp; This certainty
allows the experience to be repeated again and again.&nbsp; Everybody likes
dancing with certain partners and they do it every week.&nbsp; In order
to be able to do so both, the man and the woman must be perceived as being
unattached.
<p>"If a man has an interest in a special lady he will take advantage of
the brief moments between tangos to propose a secret meeting some place
else, later in the night or on another day.&nbsp; He will leave the milonga
alone as he came and she will do the same to meet for a cup of coffee in
some confiteria nearby.&nbsp; Acceptance on the part of the woman means
that at the very least she is interested as well.&nbsp; This preserves
the intimacy of their personal lives and allows them to continue dancing
with the several partners of their choice.
<p>"Now I imagine if a man plays some of the numbers described by Hyla
on an Argentine woman she will stop dancing and say something such as 'Excuse
me, but I got a sudden spell of nausea, I am afraid I could vomit on your
shirt, so I better go and sit down.'&nbsp; She will tell all her friends
what happened and nobody will dance with that character again.&nbsp; He
will have to leave the milonga."
<p>I would add that in a U.S. tango community, which is typically much
smaller, women alerting each other to a man's inappropriate behavior is
likely to drive him from the community altogether.&nbsp; I have seen it
happen.

the remarkable Hyla Dickinson writes:
<p>"[I]f a man's technique deteriorates completely and he stops dancing,
losing his axis and frame and connection in order to (unmusically) rub
his leg, his hands, or his groin all over his partner, is this really so
seductive?&nbsp; It can be done quite easily in many settings, no reason
to take classes or pay the entrada to a milonga.&nbsp; Most people on on
this list would agree that we go dancing because we want to dance.&nbsp;
Any sexual whatevers that come up are bonus points. (Or sometimes beside
the point).
<p>"... [S]ex is fairly cheap and easy to come by if you go to the right
bars and/or street corners.&nbsp; Lower your standards enough and it could
be free.&nbsp; When a woman laments about all the objections to 'sexy tango,'
bemoaning attempts to neuter it and take away the seductiveness that to
her is the heart of tango, it doesn't seem to me that she is looking forward
for a quick and dirty encounter in the bathroom stall at the next cortina.&nbsp;
What she seems to enjoy is the art of seduction, the suggestiveness, the
satisfaction of being in the know, more worldly than the rest of the people
in the room.&nbsp; There is a little subtext going on between you and the
man you are entwined with, it is a little secret, half hidden, half obvious,
and who is to know from looking whether it is for real or just a game.&nbsp;
Is it a 3 minute affair, or is it just the only *visible* 3 minutes of
the affair?
<p>"When another woman objects that the connection is lost when a man's
interest becomes too personal (particularly in a sexual way), rather remaining
focused on the dance, it seems to me that her objections
are not so much to the delightful delicious little naughtiness of shared
references to private acts performed in public.&nbsp; What is objectionable
is those icky, inartistic, overt and clumsy gropings which are merely nasty
and tasteless.&nbsp; How many of us women have been subjected to those
awful dances where the man's only conception of tango is that it is 'really
sexy to have a woman draped all over you,' so all he does is maneuver you
into some awkward and uncomfortable but suggestive pose (ignoring line
of dance, the music, navigation, lead/follow etc.), then shuffle himself
around and haul you into yet another uncomfortable and stupid pose, this
time gazing meaningfully into your eyes, and so on with a specially dramatic
pose at the end?&nbsp; This is not dancing, it is not sexy, suggestive
or seductive; it is gross and unpleasant and no fun at all.&nbsp; Maybe
with the circumspection in some countries, it never becomes an issue for
some women.&nbsp; But I've suffered through this more than enough.
<p>"Some men I find extraordinarily attractive as dancers but real turn-offs
sexually.&nbsp; To me, if a man does not have the right scent, he can dance
like a god (or Gavito), look like Adonis (or Adrian Brody), be a master
of sparkling wit and sexy innuendo, and all he will ever be to me is a
great dance partner.&nbsp; That's how I'm wired.&nbsp; As a consequence,
I have never aspired to meet Mr. Right or even Mr. One Night Stand on the
dance floor.&nbsp; If a man is interested, he needs to figure out if it
is mutual.&nbsp; I object when a man assumes that the successful completion
of a gancho means I'm "easy".&nbsp; Many other women share my feelings
in this.&nbsp; Now, I can have a great time playing that seduction game
when it is part of the dance, when the dance does not suffer.&nbsp; But
even in those rare cases when his pheromones fire up my hormones, if the
guy's dance degenerates so he can play grabby games, then it's over.&nbsp;
All the fun is gone.
<p>"Yeah, it is hilarious sometimes to be twining legs in very provocative
positions on a public dance floor, and we've all had our share of dances
when we come off the floor all flushed and breathless for reasons other
than the speed of the music.&nbsp; Why be ashamed of it?&nbsp; It's all
part of living life in the most fully human manner possible.&nbsp; But
there are always little signals going on within the dance that let you
know how the other partner is responding to these little overtures.&nbsp;
The guys whose only intent is copping a feel don't pay attention to those
signals, they assume things that we have not given permission for regardless
of our body language or behaviors, and those of us who have been sending
signals of 'Whoa, not so fast, not so far, it's just a dance'&nbsp; then
end up feeling used and slimy.
<p>"When I agree to dance with a man, I agree to participate in a lovely
connection with seduction or suggestiveness as possible parts of the game
to a lesser or greater extent.&nbsp; I do not agree to be mauled, humped
or used as a masturbation post.&nbsp; Now, during the course of the dance,
maybe we renegotiate aspects of what we are willing to do together.&nbsp;
Some guys maybe I'd be more willing to be a bit more, umm, explicit? naughty?
with.&nbsp; Some will be encouraged into a very very open embrace.&nbsp;
Sometimes it is clear that we are understanding the most explicit of moves
as simple physical dance challenges.&nbsp; Sometimes we negotiate a sort
of goof off riff doing 'sexy' or 'suggestive' moves so asexually that it
becomes quite funny.&nbsp; Maybe we negotiate a continuation of the game
beyond the milonga.&nbsp; But this all comes from that same listening and
sensitivity.&nbsp; We need to read one another's intentions.&nbsp; Without
that, it's not seduction, it's 'tango rape,' or at least 'tango harassment.'
<p>"And here's almost the opposite: we dance very close and never do anything
that would look the slightest bit sexy from outside but it feels like something
very special—not from rubbing or intertwining, but from just the closeness
and sharing, the tightening of the embrace at a crucial moment, the breathing
together, standing still together in the most attentive way possible.&nbsp;
If I were to compare this to sex, I think that I would say that it is not
so much like the sex act itself, but like those moments of extreme closeness
that come after the act.&nbsp; Or like those moments in a long and successful
relationship when you feel so close to the loved one, so in harmony, that
you can eat a meal together each lifting the fork or water glass in concert
and people at the restaurant ask you which anniversary you are celebrating,
without ever having seen anything so overt as hand-holding.&nbsp; 'Bread
I ate with you was more than food, wine I drank with you was more than
wine.'&nbsp; Now, to be able to experience THAT in a three minute dance
is pretty special."

Hyla Dickinson writes:
<br>"When I think of examples of a woman participating more fully in the
dance, the first that spring to mind are the visually interesting items,
the ones that I, as a dancer, think about and have worked on more consciously.&nbsp;
But when I started to think about specific answers, I asked myself 'what
were the first steps I took toward participating more fully?&nbsp; What
did the men who danced with me do that encouraged me to keep going, to
expand more of myself into the dance?'
<p>"It began with things much more integral than foot taps or balance or
exercises, things that are hidden from outside view, but central to the
feel of the dance.&nbsp; I think they are prerequisites for the more obvious
expressions of musicality.&nbsp; To do more obvious things, good solid
technique is a must.&nbsp; I did not do embellishments at all for at least
two years, I was too insecure in my balance, technique, etc.&nbsp; So I
had to get all that under my belt to consciously add anything.&nbsp; And
it took longer yet to have confidence enough to take those additions out
of the practica, to the milonga.&nbsp; But I was still actively participating
before I could do those things.
<p>"When my technique was not good enough to really support add-ons or
'riffs' or taps or whatever, I was still always trying to listen to the
music.&nbsp; I would change my breathing, the tension or density throughout
my body, the weight of my footfall.&nbsp; I would alter the feel of the
embrace, snuggle in or be more aloof.&nbsp; Most of this was only dimly
conscious, in the very back of my mind or my body; it was the response
to the music that was foremost in my mind.&nbsp; This is something that
the more sensitive and musical leaders will always notice, even when I
don't notice it myself.&nbsp; It is a 'hidden' part of the conversation.
<p>"I still do all of these things, sometimes consciously, sometimes not.&nbsp;
These are things that I can do with men who are not yet confident enough
in their lead to support more obvious input.&nbsp; They might be the only
things I 'add' when dancing with someone whose musicality or interpretation
are new to me, or so interesting in themselves and yet somehow inclusive
of me, that I don't feel the need to add anything.&nbsp; It is the basis
for all the other 'riffs' or 'play' that I ever do."

<p>Music is a pathway to finding connection, so is imagination.

Hyla Dickinson writes:
<br>"I was dancing with a man whose musicality I really respect.&nbsp;
It was a practica, they were playing the slow instrumental Di Sarli.&nbsp;
I was just starting to make the transition from thinking of Di Sarli as
'that slow, simple, boring, out of date beginner's music' but I wasn't
quite there yet.&nbsp; This man began leading things that made no sense
to me, but as I said, I really respected his musicality.&nbsp; So I started
listening to find what he could possibly be hearing in the music, trying
to make his lead work.&nbsp; I did not want to do something to embarrass
myself and lose his respect.&nbsp; I began hearing things in that music
that opened Di Sarli out in ways I could never have imagined.&nbsp; It's
not simple!&nbsp; Not boring at all!&nbsp; My gosh, the layers of complexity,
the opportunities for subtlety and finesse!
<p>"At the end of the tanda, this man said, 'gee, I was trying to see all
through that dance if I could make you dance unmusically, and I just couldn't
make you do it!'&nbsp; Because I assumed that he was leading musically,
I unconsciously refused to dance unmusically and thus forced him to allow
me to find a musical moment to dance to.&nbsp; Which in turn forced me
to look for, and find, more of those moments in the depths of the music.&nbsp;
It worked because he was sensitive enough to me that he respected my "refusal",
and sensitive enough to the music that he heard what I discovered in it.&nbsp;
He later remarked to several people 'You just gotta dance Di Sarli with
her!'
<p>"I'm not sure what the moral of that story is, but if there is one,
follow it!&nbsp; It was a fabulous experience!"

<br>"It was a small milonga, and as soon as I walked in I said to myself,
'Oh, well, too bad there aren't any good dancers here tonight.'&nbsp; (In
other words, my snotty ego was already setting me up to have a disappointing
evening.)&nbsp; Fortunately, I spotted Mr. P on the floor and decided I
wanted to dance with him.&nbsp; I hadn't thought too highly of him as a
dancer ('Such an awkward, unsteady embrace he has'), but a few weeks earlier
I had seen him perform as a musician and been dazzled by his talent and
passion.&nbsp; This was something I wanted to connect with.
<p>"I began dancing with Mr. P and, rather than trying to connect with
him merely through the physical mechanics of&nbsp; the embrace, I somehow
made the lucky decision to connect with him by trying to mirror (or imitate)
the qualities of his own stance and movement, the intense hunch of his
upper body, the slight wobble that came after each step.I tried my best
to 'become' Mr. P, to reflect him back to himself.&nbsp; It felt overly
theatrical for the first few seconds, but, oh, how electrifying the connection
between us became.&nbsp; I had the (if only physical) sensation of what
it might be like to *be* Mr. P.&nbsp; And he blossomed in my arms, sensing
the recognition and respect I was sending his way, sensing that I was trying
to maximize my enjoyment of him.
<p>"His dancing became much more confident, and (without losing his own
essential qualities) he started to control his movements more and to really
play with me in the dance.&nbsp; Suddenly the hunched stance felt like
a strong expression of gravity, and the wobble felt like the tender lingering
aftereffect of each pulse of music.&nbsp; What a revelation: Mr. P was
beautiful dancer, and I had been a prig not to see it!
<p>"After that tanda, I found that every man I danced with that evening
had something beautiful to offer, no matter their postural eccentricites
or limitations of technique. In fact, their eccentricities and limitations
were something to be respected and accorded a value, something that added
rich flavor to the dance.&nbsp; If my partner is stiff as a board, well,
it means that we begin the tanda by doing the "stiff as a board" tango,
which can offer some very creative moments of shared comedy, playing close
to the edge of being off-balance.&nbsp; Whee-ha-ha.&nbsp; Maybe by the
end of the tanda our dance will have expanded into something more soft
and flexible and grounded, maybe not.&nbsp; The cortina has its own great
value, after all.
<p>"I left the milonga that night feeling thrilled and humbled.&nbsp; How
sorely I had underestimated these "bad dancers," how foolishly I had cheated
myself out of the deeper pleasures of connecting in the dance.&nbsp; It
wan't somebody else's fat ego getting in the way of dancing, it was my
own.
<p>"That night helped me appreciate the talented leaders who use this type
of 'body empathy' when they dance with me, recognizing and valuing all
my own eccentricities, discovering how to enjoy them.&nbsp; And I now understand
why I see so many talented leaders sitting out tandas—it takes time to
recover from the intensity of *truly shared* dancing, to clear one's 'psychomotor
palate,' so to speak."

<br>19 June 2005 — Stephen Brown
<p>There are three principal methods for teaching Argentine tango: step
patterns, small elements, and structural systems.&nbsp; These three approaches
are analagous to three pedagogical approaches used for teaching and learning
how to play jazz music.&nbsp; Learning step patterns is like learning to
play memorized pieces of music including complete compositions and the
solos played by great jazz artists.&nbsp; Learning small elements is like
learning to play in short tasty phrases.&nbsp; Learning structural systems
are like learning scales and chord progressions.
<p>Those aspiring to play jazz study complete compositions and the solos
played by great artists, short tasty phrases and the scales and chord progressions.&nbsp;
No one would expect to develop sufficient skill by pursuing only one of
these three approahces to learning.
<p>In tango, however, many dancers develop most of their knowledge of the
dance through only one of the three principal approaches for teaching Argentine
tango.&nbsp; What is the consequence?&nbsp; Those who only learn step patterns
often show good depth of composition and form, but find trouble with improvisation,
navigation and rhythm.&nbsp; Those who only learn small elements often
have good navigational and rhythm skills, but the dancing can lack a sense
of composition, form, style or depth of improvisation.&nbsp; It's just
noodling.&nbsp; Those who only learn a structural system understand a complex
set of possibilities, but may lack form and have trouble fitting the concepts
to the available space or the rhythm of the music.
<p>With persistent work, many people will break through the limitations
of the single method by which they were taught tango, but I think it is
much easier to develop a well-rounded mastery by pursuing all three methods
of learning.&nbsp; Some of my previous thoughts about mixing these various
methods of learning Argentine tango can be found at <a href="inside_2004archive.html#0008">Approaches

<br>"I am a foreign woman living in BsAs.&nbsp; I learned to dance tango
here 8 years ago.&nbsp; When I lived in L.A. and danced around the U.S.,
I found the custom of inviting people to dance absolutely barbaric compared
to the Codigo [social codes] here.&nbsp; In the U.S. men may come to you
to ask you to dance and even if you don't want to, you usually accept,
because we are trained not to be rude.&nbsp; I used to give many "mercy"
dances during any given milonga.&nbsp; And it's true, if a man walks all
the way across the floor to offer himself to you for 7 minutes, it's very
embarrassing for him to walk back, rejected.&nbsp; Also in the States and
in Europe, it is very common for the woman to run around the room, inviting
men to dance.&nbsp; I find it difficult to be aggressive in making a man
lead me, in fact, I find it impossible.
<p>"I LOVE the Codigo here!&nbsp; I feel so empowered.&nbsp; Nobody knows
if I refuse someone.&nbsp; I give no mercy dances.&nbsp; I dance with whom
I want to, to the music I want to.&nbsp; I feel in control: no man can
approach my table without permission.&nbsp; There is none of the sitting
down with you and monopolizing that often occurs in the U.S.&nbsp; I LOVE
IT!
<p>"Of course I'm speaking about the traditional formal milongas here.
There are many places for young people which have no codigo—and where I
feel vulnerable and with less control."

Nitin Kibe adds:
<br>"I would also like to mention symmetry between the capital spent in
asking and the effort spent in rejecting.&nbsp; Most asymmetric scenario:
Man makes long lonely visible walk across floor, woman rejects brusquely
in a nanosecond.&nbsp; Same outcome but better symmetry and so less bad
feeling: woman spends more time, softens the blow with smiles, small talk,
lets him down gently, etc. etc.&nbsp; Cabeceo has good symmetry: neither
party spends much capital/effort, a glance, raised eyebrow from the one;
a slight yes/no nod from the other; no particularly hard feelings, no visibly
bruised ego, la milonga continua."

one dancer to the other.&nbsp; You may be from one country and I from another,

boom box and speakers pulled through the Gates on a small luggage cart.

little or no red tape, interesting environment.&nbsp; And run or tango

<p><a NAME="0008"></a><b><font size=+1>Cultural Values and Styles of Argentine
Tango</font></b>
<br>20 February 2005 — Stephen Brown
<p>Linking cultural stereotypes about a city to the way people dance Argentine
tango in that city may be fun, but it probably doesn't reflect reality.&nbsp;
The average person in any given city doesn't dance Argentine tango.&nbsp;
Argentine tango attracts only a small minority of the population in each
city where it is danced, and it seems that a higher percentage of those
who dance Argentine tango in most cities have grown up somewhere else than
is true of the city's general population.
<p>Argentine tango acts as filter on the general population.&nbsp; It attracts
those people who are most comfortable with what the dance demands.&nbsp;
As the result of such sorting, tango dancers in various cities and countries
around the world are likely to have more in common with each other than
the average persons in these cities and countries do.
<p>With filtering finding commonalities, how do we account for the differences
in styles across communities?&nbsp; To overgeneralize, I will say there
are three aspects of tango—social contact, athleticism, and theatricality.&nbsp;
Some communities may emphasize the social contact aspects of tango.&nbsp;
Other communities may emphasize theatricality or athleticism.
<p>The observed differences in styles across tango communities likely owes
more to differences in the tastes or knowledge of the pioneering instructors
and organizers than to the inherent characteristics of the city's general
population.&nbsp; Those who pioneered Argentine tango in their community
provided the first filters and built a group of dancers based on what they
liked/knew.&nbsp; If the early instructors and organizers emphasized theatricality—as
was true in many cities outside of Buenos Aires—strong aspects of that
thread are likely to continue today.&nbsp; Given the small percentage of
people in any city who dance tango, attributing the style of tango dancing
in a city to that city's culture is a bit silly, even if it does entertain
us by fitting our cultural stereotypes.

a meeting to protest that the cobblestone streets of Buenos Aires where

own!) were being paved with asphalt.&nbsp; To emphasize the protest, they
would dance on asphalt!&nbsp; Imagine their determination if they would
dance on that sticking, grinding impossible surface.&nbsp; I was moved

Rose of Portland, Oregon writes:
<br>"It is interesting to me how people choose to understand their roles
and relationship to one another within tango.
<p>"To the women that say they have perceived following to be like stepping
back in time to a gender role they no longer embrace in their normal life,
consider this: Tango does not create the role we choose, we create our
role in tango.&nbsp; Dancing is two people meeting on a dance floor expressing
themselves to one another through music and movement.&nbsp; It is mutual
and consensual and no two people will express themselves in the same way.
<p>"The mechanics of two bodies moving together require that one person
take the lead.&nbsp; Just like when you carry a couch up a flight of stairs
with one person holding each end.&nbsp; If you don't want the couch to
fall you have to work together and coordinate your movement (okay maybe
not the most elegant analogy but it kind of works).&nbsp; Beyond that though
I think it is really up to the two people involved how they choose to engender
their roles.&nbsp; Different people have different preferences.&nbsp; Some
people enjoy being passive, some people enjoy being in charge, some people
enjoy being equal with their partner, some people enjoy competing with
their partner, some people click and some don't.
<p>"It is a subtle negotiation I think.&nbsp; And it is mostly about how
you physically communicate with your partner from moment to moment.

defensive about being led only do so out of their own insecurities."

<p><a NAME="0004"></a><b><font size=+1>North American Tango Festival Season
Underway</font></b>
<br>31 January 2005 — Stephen Brown
<p>In the mid-1990s, the only recurring tango festival in North America
was at Stanford University during midsummer.&nbsp; This year's North American
tango festival season is already underway with the recently concluded Michigan
Tango Festival.&nbsp; It continues in earnest with ValenTango in Portland,
Oregon and extends through November with Fandango de Tango in Austin, Texas.&nbsp;
Some of the festivals are new, but many are annual events.
<p>Some of the festivals emphasize social dancing, and some feature big-name
instructors.&nbsp; Either way, the primary advantages of these events are
many hours of social dancing, an extensive class schedule with quality
instruction, and an opportunity to meet and dance with tango dancers from
all over.&nbsp; Many of the events are surprisingly affordable.
<p>The list has been deleted.&nbsp; For a current worldwide list of tango festivals,
see <a href="tango_links.html#festivals">Tango Festivals and Other Events</a> on this
website.&nbsp; Another resource for festival information is Tobias Conradi's

<p><a NAME="0003"></a><b><font size=+1>Milongas in Buenos Aires Reopening</font></b>
<br>28 January 2005 — Stephen Brown
<p>As the result of strict enforcement of fire codes by the city of Buenos
Aires in the wake of a tragic night club fire on December 30, 2004, most
milongas in the city were closed and their long-term status was in jeopardy.&nbsp;
Now the situation seems to be resolved by the city government recognizing
that milongas are part of the cultural patrimony of the city.
<p>A tragic fire in a night club in Buenos Aires claimed many lives on
December 30, 2004.&nbsp; See the story in the
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/31/international/americas/31club.html?ex=1105" target="new">NY
Times</a> (registration required).&nbsp; In response to the tragedy, the
president of Argentina declared several days of mourning, during which
all dance halls, including those hosting milongas, were closed.&nbsp; Fairly
quickly, the city of Buenos Aires began strict enforcement of its fire
codes on all night clubs and dance halls—requiring all such venues to have
a newly issued permit.&nbsp; As Janis Kenyon reported to
<a href="http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2005/msg00165.html" target="new">Tango-L</a>
on January 13, these codes and the accompanying permits created significant
obstacles to reopening the milongas.
<p>Less than ten days later, Shahrukh Merchant reported on
<a href="http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2005/msg00267.html" target="new">Tango-L</a>
that dancers were protesting about milongas being closed.&nbsp; According
to Merchant's report, "A crowd of 150-200 people chanted on the streets
around 4:00 a.m. early this morning outside Club Villa Malcolm, where the
relocated Canning Milonga had been closed down by the police a little earlier.&nbsp;
... [P]olice sent in reinforcements to direct traffic around [the dancers]
into the one open lane (relieving Julio Balmaceda from that task)."&nbsp;
See <a href="http://www.shahrukhmerchant.com/tango/tango_protesta.htm" target="new">Shahrukh's
photos</a> and the story in <a href="http://buscador.lanacion.com.ar/Nota.asp?nota_id=673472" target="new">La
Nacion</a>.
<p>Because milongas are quite a bit different than the type of event that
resulted in the tragedy of the Club Croma&ntilde;on fire, dancers questioned
why such strict enforcement was being directed at milongas.&nbsp; In addition,
tango is deeply rooted in the Argentine culture and accounts for about
half the tourists in Buenos Aires.&nbsp; As Shahrukh wrote, "All this gives
a different dimension to the ... closures:&nbsp; Safety comes first, no
doubt, but when the brush is painted too broadly, and decisions seem increasingly
arbitrary, there is an economic and cultural cost as well."&nbsp; A protest
milonga was set for Saturday, January 29 at the obelisco in Buenos Aires.
<p>Today, Alberto Gesualdi reported on <a href="http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2005/msg00334.html" target="new">Tango-L</a>
that the milongas will be reopening soon because the city of Buenos Aires
has found away to exempt milongas from its strict enforcement fire codes.&nbsp;
A special decree exempting milongas from the enforcement was approved by
the city of Buenos Aires on January 27.&nbsp; The exemption is based on
1998 city law that establishes tango as the cultural patrimony of the city
of Buenos Aires.&nbsp; Registration will be required of the milongas to
prevent the possibility of dancing places claiming to be milongas to quality
for the exemption.&nbsp; See the story in <a href="http://buscador.lanacion.com.ar/Nota.asp?nota_id=674885" target="new">La

<br>As a follower who loves to play in and explore all possibilities and
styles in tango, I would venture to clarify, at least based on my OWN experience
dancing ... , that while the "push" connection is an option, the more expressive
and satisfying one for me could be described more like "melting" toward
my partner.&nbsp; I have Tomas Howlin to thank for insisting very specifically
on practicing/using this very yummy, lovely and specific element, which
is attainable no matter how open or closed the embrace.&nbsp; Applying
[the] same to transitions between open and close is also extraordinarily
powerful and makes for VERY compelling connections between partners (gracias,
Tomas!).

<p><a NAME="0001"></a><b><font size=+1>Dancing to the Music (4)</font></b>
<br>1 January 2005 — Stephen Brown
<p>Some of the basic skills for interpreting Argentine tango music while
dancing are:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Moving to the slow, walking beat (<a href="inside_2004archive.html#0006">Rhuummmp</a>);
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Moving to the staccato rhythms (<a href="inside_2004archive.html#0006">Ric
Tic</a>);
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Working with pauses (while beats slip away);
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) Moving with musical phrasing;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) Moving with musical phrasing for lyrical tangos.
<p>Some of the more advanced skills for interpreting Argentine tango music
while dancing are:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Interpreting changes in tempo;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Moving to syncopated rhythms (those of Troilo
in particular);
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Dancing to the rhythms of individual instruments
rather than working just with the beat;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) Using repitition and variation;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) Using movements whose rhythms play against those
in the music.
