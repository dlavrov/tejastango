<br>29 May 2011 — Stephen Brown
<p>Over at  
<a href="http://melinas-two-cent.blogspot.com/2011/02/weve-just-returned-from-italy.html" target="new">Melina's two cents</a>,
Melina Sedo considers the confusion that has developed over use of the terms
"tango de salon" and "tango milonguero."&nbsp; As Melina (and I) originally
understood the term, "tango de salon" was danced socially by milongueros and
milongueras at milongas.&nbsp;<p>According to what Melina learned from the milongueros and milongueras that she met,
<br>"[A]ll of them danced their personal interpretation of tango de salon, allowing
for many kinds of embraces, from very close to a half open V-form.&nbsp; Some of
them danced complex movements with real pivots and even ganchos; some just walked
to the music.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; Tete danced tango de salon as well as El Indio
or Hernan Obispo.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; Tango orillero, tango del centro, tango liso,
tango apilado, tango Villa Urquiza, tango milonguero [were] ... sub-styles of the
tango de salon with one common idea: ... to dance socially."
<p>Because salon-style tango (tango de salon) became synonymous with a hybrid of
social tango and stage tango in the United States and parts of Europe, Susana Miller
who focused on a limited set of simple movements with small steps began calling what
she taught, "tango milonguero" and that term become widely applied to all forms of
social tango danced in a close embrace.&nbsp; Those of us who dance and/or teach
other social forms of tango, find the labeling misleading and difficult to swallow.&nbsp;
As Melina writes, "We still dance tango de salon.&nbsp; Social tango."

<p><a NAME="0005"></a><b><font size=+1>Myths About Dancing Tango</font></b>
<br>1 May 2011 — Stephen Brown
<p>Over at  
<a href="http://tangoandchaos.org/comments_updates_new.htm" target="new">Tango and Chaos</a>,
Rick McGarrey considers three myths about tango he wishes would go away.
<p><b>Myth 1:</b> "If it's crowded I dance milonguero style tango, but later in the evening,
I like to dance other styles."
<p><b>Rick:</b> "I don't know any social dancers who wait for the floor to clear so they can
dance some other kind of tango.&nbsp; I've never seen it happen in Buenos Aires.&nbsp; I also
don't know any good social dancers who say they dance 'milonguero style tango'—or, for
that matter, who say they dance any 'style' of tango."
<p><b>Myth 2:</b> "We dance alternative tango in a milonga with no problems.&nbsp; We control
our dancing, and when there's space, we get more creative."
<p><b>Rick:</b> "Translation: 'If I didn't kick you, I didn't bother you.'&nbsp; This is the
rationale of people who do what they want in milongas.&nbsp; They may not bother anyone when
it's early and there's no one on the floor, but as it begins to get more crowded, whether they
know it or not, they do bother other dancers.&nbsp; As far as academic dancing being more
creative, I've heard this argument—but to me, it looks mostly like choreography from workshops."
<p><b>Myth 3:</b> "There is no room in tango for prejudice, discrimination, or closed
minds.&nbsp; Milongas should be open to everyone."
<p><b>Rick:</b> "Prejudice and discrimination apply to things like race and religion—not to the
way someone decides to dance.&nbsp; You can't go into a chess club and insist on playing
dominoes.&nbsp; And a beginning basketball player can't expect to walk into a gym and join a
pick-up game with college and pro level players.&nbsp; To dance in a milonga you need a certain
level of competence, and you need to respect the codigos."

<p><a NAME="0004"></a><b><font size=+1>The Continuing Conflict Over Tango Styles</font></b>
<br>17 April 2011 — Stephen Brown
<p><a href="../pix/Tango1.jpg"><img SRC="../pix/Tango1.jpg" ALT="click to enlarge" height=240 width=320 align=LEFT></a>
In the late 1800s and early 1900s tango split into two styles.&nbsp; One style,
known as "tango liso" was danced in tango salons (indoors).&nbsp;  Limited by space,
tango liso was characterized by care to follow the line of dance, smooth movements, a
lack of double-time steps and the use of relatively simple elements that would not
disrupt the line of dance.&nbsp; The other style, known as "tango orillero" was danced
in the streets of poor outlying tenements in Buenos Aires.&nbsp; Not confined by space,
orillero was a rougher style with more highly rhythmic movements that did not show
respect for a line of dance.
<p>Although the two styles had similar origins in canyengue, the class distinctions
between the styles created rivalry.&nbsp; Because tango had its origins in working class
neighborhoods and orillero seemed closer to canyengue, the more refined tango liso was
denounced by some as inauthentic.&nbsp; In return, tango orillero was dismissed as only
suitable for individuals of dubious backgrounds.
<p><a href="../pix/Tango2.jpg"><img SRC="../pix/Tango2.jpg" ALT="click to enlarge" height=240 width=320 align=RIGHT></a>
By the 1940s and early 50s, tango had evolved into a multiplicity of styles.&nbsp; Tango
liso gradually evolved into what many now call estilo Villa Urquiza, a name that reflects its
onetime prominence in a northern neighborhood of Buenos Aires known as Villa Urquiza.&nbsp; It
was also likely that the Villa Urquiza style was known as "tango de salon" at one time.&nbsp;
Such a name would recognize that the style was danced in most of the salons throughout Buenos
Aires, and it would distinguish the style from orillero, which evolved in the streets.
<p>Orillero-style dancers gradually moved from the streets to small indoor clubs.&nbsp; They
took their rhythmic sensibilities with them, but modified the dance to fit smaller spaces.&nbsp;
As a result, the club and milonguero styles of tango emerged.&nbsp; The club and milonguero
styles are substantially similar to each other, mostly reflecting a continuum of personal
differences, with club-style tango sharing some of the characteristics of the Villa Urquiza
style of tango.&nbsp; (See <a href="tango_styles.html" target="new">Styles of Argentine Tango</a>.)
<p>Although the Villa Urquiza, club and milonguero styles of tango were all eventually recognized
as tango de salon, the rivalry between styles remained.&nbsp; Refined women refused to dance in
the neighborhood clubs where club or milonguero styles of tango were danced, or even to use the
double-time steps that characterizes the two styles.&nbsp; Those dancing club and milonguero
tango saw themselves as dancing a style of tango that had a straight-line history to the origins
of tango without the contamination of middle-class pretensions.
<p>In the late 1940s and early 50s, some of the better dancers of estilo Villa Urquiza also began
to develop their skills for tango exhibitions.&nbsp; In doing so, they created tango fantasia, a
style that builds on estilo Villa Urquiza but uses embellishments more extensively and adds
dramatic poses, ganchos and high boleos, all of which have their roots in some part of tango's
history.&nbsp; The creation of tango stage productions led to the development of tango escenario,
which integrated fantasia with elements from ballet and other dance forms.
<p><a href="../pix/Tango3.jpg"><img SRC="../pix/Tango3.jpg" ALT="click to enlarge" height=240 width=320 align=LEFT></a>
Tango was mostly dormant from the late 1950s through the mid-1980s.&nbsp; The tango salons were
closed, and the Villa Urquiza style that may have once dominated tango in Buenos Aires was danced
mostly by older couples at family gatherings.&nbsp; Some milongueros continued to dance club and
milonguero style tango at clubs de barrios, but the Argentine government cracked down on the
milonguero life style.&nbsp; Tango stage shows continued to be produced with fantasia as the dominant
form in the more authentic shows.
<p>The stage show <i>Tango Argentino</i> created a revival of interest in tango in the late 1980s and
early 1990s, first in Europe and then North America.&nbsp; An enthralled public wanted to learn what
they saw in <i>Tango Argentino</i>, which was mostly fantasia.&nbsp; The stage dancers, many of whom
had limited backgrounds in the social forms of tango, began teaching what they knew to dancers in Europe
and North America, mostly as memorized figures.
<p>Perhaps trying to emphasize the refined social roots of their dance, the Argentine stage dancers
frequently identified what they taught as tango de salon, which was translated to salon-style tango in
English.&nbsp; This identification created confusion in many tango communities where the term
salon-style tango became most closely associated with fantasia and to some extent Villa Urquiza.&nbsp;
In Buenos Aires, tango de salon remained associated with all social styles of tango dancing.&nbsp; The
common style shared by the two  different labels was estilo Villa Urquiza, once the dominant form of
tango in Buenos Aires.
<p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, milongueros who specialized in the club and milonguero styles of
tango reemerged from the clubs de barrio.&nbsp; At the same time, many foreigners began visiting Buenos
Aires to dance tango.&nbsp; As the two styles met on crowded dance floors, serious conflicts arose. 
<p>The conflict between the salon-style tango danced by the foreigners and the tango de salon danced by the
milongueros was to some extent practical.&nbsp; The memorized figures with exhibition elements didn't work
in crowded venues where the milongueros danced.&nbsp; The densely packed floor demanded improvisational
and navigational skills which the visitors lacked.&nbsp; The conditions also required the use of only those
dance elements that could be executed safely with others close by, which the visitors didn't understand.
<p>The conflict also had its roots in the social split that occurred in tango's early years.&nbsp; The
origin of the milonguero/club style was in orillero, while the origin of the style danced by most foreigners
was in  tango liso.&nbsp; Many milongueros denounced what the foreigners called salon-style tango as
inauthentic stage tango that was poorly danced and unsuitable for use in crowded milongas.
<p>As tango's popularity grew, a new round of teachers emerged in the mid-1990s and early 2000s who taught
tango in the styles of the milongueros.&nbsp; The emergence of this group of teachers created a practical
and philosophical split in many tango communities.&nbsp; The milonguero-style instructors emphasized
learning tango in small rhythmic elements that could be combined improvisationally.&nbsp; The
salon-style instructors emphasized refined movements and memorized figures. 
<p>Nuevo tango also emerged in the 1990s.&nbsp; As it was originally conceived, nuevo tango was largely a
pedagogic approach to tango that emphasized a structural analysis of the Villa Urquiza, fantasia and orillero
styles of tango  through which the connections between tango's elements could be explored and new combinations
and step patterns could be found.&nbsp; Some of the dancers exploring tango's possibilities gradually
developed nuevo tango into a style that is danced in an open, loose or elastic embrace with a very upright
posture and a great emphasis on the dancers maintaining their own axes.&nbsp; Although the vocabulary was
strictly tango, some of the combinations were fresh and unusual.
<p><a href="../pix/Tango4.jpg"><img SRC="../pix/Tango4.jpg" ALT="click to enlarge" height=240 width=320 align=RIGHT></a>
By the  early 2000s, tango seemed to be splitting into three distinct styles that were very different when taken
to their extremes.&nbsp; These styles included a milonguero/club style that emphasized a close embrace, small
rhythmic movements and improvisation; a fantasia-centered style, mostly known as salon-style tango outside
Buenos Aires, that emphasized quality of movement and was frequently taught as memorized figures; and a
nuevo style that often employed a loose embrace and emphasized the exploration of movements through the
development of a structural understanding of tango's possibilities.&nbsp; Although each of the styles draws
deeply on tango's history, practical and philosophical conflicts emerged as each style was taken to its
extreme.&nbsp; (See <a href="inside_2004archive.html#0007">Taking Tango Styles to Extremes</a>.)
<p>Aside from polarizing comments made by the adherents in each of the three stylistic groups, several other
factors have added to the appearance that tango has broken into three distinct styles.&nbsp; Estilo Villa
Urquiza, which links the various styles through it commonalities, never recovered from tango's dormancy to
regain the prominence it enjoyed in the 1940s and early 50s.&nbsp; Other styles eclipsed Villa Urquiza, and
it began to disappear as an older generation of porte&ntilde;os died.&nbsp; As a result, many dancers have
difficulty seeing how the diverging styles are part of tango's whole.
<p>In addition, the differing methods for teaching each of the styles has accentuated the differences between
the styles.&nbsp; The many dancers whose learning is incomplete within each style have substantially different
limitations in their dancing, and those limitations have been interpreted as part of each style.&nbsp;
Incomplete learning in milonguero/club tango typically results in dancers who plod along to the music without
much quality of movement, sense of form or inventiveness.&nbsp; Incomplete learning in salon-style tango
typically results in dancers who execute memorized patterns without rhythm or the ability to navigate.&nbsp;
Incomplete learning in the nuevo style typically results in dancers who spin out of control without much rhythm
as they explore tango's possibilities.&nbsp; (See <a href="inside_2005archive.html#0028">On Style and Styles
(4)</a>, <a href="inside_2005archive.html#0015">Incomplete Education</a> and
<a href="inside_2007archive.html#0010">Approaches to Learning and Authenticity</a>.) 
<p>The overall appearance in the tango world is of three seemingly conflicting styles of tango that are pulling
apart because there is no central gravity strong enough to hold them together.

<p><a NAME="0003"></a><b><font size=+1>Nuevo Milonguero</font></b>
<br>13 April 2011 — Stephen Brown
<p>In a recent post over at
<a href="http://tangovoice.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/tango-estilo-milonguero-nuevo-nuevo-milonguero/" target="new">Tango Voice</a>,
the anonymous blogger considers what is meant by the term "nuevo milonguero" which
he re-anoints as "tango estilo milonguero nuevo."&nbsp; He reaches the conclusion
that nuevo milonguero is a close-embrace variation of nuevo-style tango, which is in
direct contradiction of <a href="tango_styles.html#nuevo_milonguero" target="new">my
previously expressed view</a> that nuevo milonguero was created by adding nuevo elements
to milonguero-style tango.
<p>His reasoning?
<br>"With its maintained close embrace and small steps (when necessary) Tango Milonguero
is designed for the high density characteristic of milonga dance floors in Buenos Aires.&nbsp;
Tango Nuevo is identified by its focus on the exploration of possibilities for movement,
which by its very nature requires space and freedom of direction in movement.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;
Although the addition of Tango Nuevo elements to Tango Milonguero ... creates an
incompatible mix, the converse mixture is viable.&nbsp; The addition of the characteristic
closed embrace of Tango Milonguero to Tango Nuevo does not limit the latter's ability to
improvise because the milonguero embrace is only part of the continuum of distances and
variations in partner connection that are characteristically passed through in dancing
Tango Nuevo."
<p>Although I agree with Tango Voice's view that nuevo elements can be incompatible with
the original purpose of milonguero-style tango (which is dancing in crowded spaces), I do
not understand the substitution of logic for history.&nbsp; Those who developed what has
become known as "nuevo milonguero" are dancers and instructors closely associated with
milonguero-style tango.&nbsp; They added nuevo-inspired steps to their dancing in way that
they considered compatible with the <i>movements</i> of milonguero-style tango, if not the
unwritten codes for tango de salon in Buenos Aires.&nbsp; Whether their motivation was
marketing or a desire to punch up the milonguero style in the face of the nuevo onslaught,
I don't know.
<p>Either way, I see Tango Voice as paying insufficient attention to tango's history in the
pursuit of his self-appointed mission "to counter the prevailing tendency to misrepresent tango argentino
in North America."
