<p><a NAME="0029"></a><b><font size=+1>Blogging: Truth or Truthiness?</font></b>
<br>26 November 2007 — Stephen Brown
<p>Does the blogosphere or online discussion groups such as <a href="http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/" target="new">Tango-L</a>
generate truth, or what Stephen Colbert calls 'truthiness,' the latter
being facts or concepts one only wishes or believes to be true?
<p>An <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/153255832130u522/" target="new">article</a>
recently published in <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/100332/" target="new">Public
Choice</a> (subscription required) by <a href="http://www.duke.edu/~munger/" target="new">Michael
C. Munger</a> examines the information content of political blogs.&nbsp;
Munger finds that bloggers and the mainstream media face the same difficulties
if they wish to rely on the blogosphere as a generator of truth.&nbsp;
Both bloggers and media converge on a small number of key blogs operated
by elite opinion makers as sources of information.&nbsp; But these elite
opinion makers are highly aware of how political discourse is conducted
and are likely to resist any information that doesn't conform to their
existing attitudes and beliefs.&nbsp; In addition, blogs and blog readers
are likely to separate themselves into smaller networks of people who hold
substantially similar views.&nbsp; These factors tend to generate biased,
polarizing views that are self-perpetuating, and people develop an us-versus-them
mentality.
<p>Munger's conclusion runs counter to a perhaps commonly held view that
the blogosphere can serve as marketplace for information that approximates
a parallel processing statistical estimator of the truth with nice properties
as additional observers are added.&nbsp; The key to a good outcome is that
there is some mechanism for sharing and aggregating the information and
that observers are independent rather than polarized.&nbsp; In a polarized
world where the additional observers replicate the information already
provided by the elite opinion makers, the independence property necessary
to avoid truthiness is destroyed.

<p>It seems to me that all of us must find our own tango in our own hearts,
souls and bodies.&nbsp; (As I have written in these pages before, good
instruction can help take the student to the door, but those who become
tango dancers step through the door themselves.)
<p>Upon finding our own tango, most of us will discover that some or much
of what we were taught is useless, but that doesn't mean we didn't benefit
from the instruction.&nbsp; The seeming misdirection and missteps are part
of the learning process.
<p>I also think that the insights we gain in finding our own tango aren't
likely to be understood by those who haven't found their own tango.&nbsp;
They may even be misunderstood by others who have found their own tango.

What do you want to do about them?'&nbsp; If you do nothing, you will be
hurt and disappointed and you will not dance.
<p>"So people do.&nbsp; Everyone.&nbsp; Often unconsciously because they
want the transformation that tango offers them.&nbsp; This is my point
that transcends cultures.&nbsp; Argentine people go through this process
as well.&nbsp; It is a process of Tango.
<p>"A much deeper level of transformation actually allows the true masculine
and feminine power to emerge.&nbsp; Once a person begins to overcome their
insecurities, it begins to show not only in tango, but in the rest of their
life.&nbsp; In a way, struggling and loving tango helps people to become
who they truly are and who they were meant to be.
<p>"Tango is an amazing place when transformations occur.&nbsp; For Argentine
people who had danced for decades, tango accompanied their life and transformations.&nbsp;
Outside of Argentina, people come to tango differently, and so tango may
be that much more powerful for them."

it or not.
<p>"The masculine and feminine power in tango do not compete with each

feminine can only be powerful if the masculine is powerful and the masculine
cannot be powerful if the feminine is not powerful.
<p>"But both men and women have both the masculine and the feminine.&nbsp;
That means that the power of the Universe is in both, not just in the women.
<p>"So in tango, the woman is not powerful if the man is not, and the man's
power is trapped, if the woman he dances with is weak in her power.&nbsp;
That is why the follower's technique classes are very
<br>useful.&nbsp; Women learn to connect with their bodies in the movement
of tango and bring forward their powerful feminine essence.
<p>"And the tango embrace is between the masculine and the feminine.&nbsp;
When the woman is in her feminine and the man is embracing her from his
feminine energy, it usually does not feel good for the woman.&nbsp; When
a woman embraces the man from her masculine power, it usually does not

<p><a NAME="0018"></a><b><font size=+1>On Perfection and Heaven</font></b>
<br>31 July 2007 — Stephen Brown
<p>Tango is a dance in which is it easy to become obsessed with perfection.&nbsp;
The taste of heaven that is found within tango may encourage some to seek
perfection.&nbsp; Others may bring their own perfectionism to tango.&nbsp;
But we should never confuse heaven and perfection.&nbsp; They are very
different.&nbsp; The path of perfectionism often leads away from heaven—as
we find ourselves accompanied and driven forward by demons (aka a monkey
mind) that become all too familiar.&nbsp; If we pursue perfection in our
practice, we are likely developing the demons that seek to keep us from
effective dancing.
<p>In tango, heaven is found through the simple gift of grace.&nbsp; That
comes from getting out on the dance floor with the person that happens
to be right for the moment, opening one's heart and falling in love again.&nbsp;
The times that this happens, one is just happy to be in the arms of another
at the end of the tanda.

<br>31 July 2007 — Stephen Brown
<p>For most people, the goal of practice is to become more effective at
dancing tango socially.&nbsp; What are the elements of effective social
dancing?&nbsp; Such dancing cannot be reduced down to a set of mechancial
skills.&nbsp; The embrace, the relationship with one's partner, the relationship
with others on the dance floor, and the relationship with music are the
context within which we dance tango.&nbsp; Practicing by oneself may help
develop some mechanical skills, such as balance, familiarity with the music,
knowledge of step patterns, etc., but they also remove the entire context
of tango.
<p>Practicing with a partner improves matters considerably because it is
closer to dancing.&nbsp; Practicing in a room full of others improves matters
even more because it is even closer to dancing.&nbsp; Some might go even
further and claim that practicing at a milonga would be even better, but
it is reasonable to recognize that social norms separate what constitutes
practice and social dance.

Even the most machismo men can not deny the powerful role of the follower.
<p>"Here are a couple of things to consider about the role of the follower
and her power to influence the dance:
<p>"1. It is the woman's choice who she dances with.&nbsp; She allows herself
to be approached or not, she selects whether or not to catch a man's gaze.&nbsp;
I would go so far as to say that most of the time it is really the woman
doing the asking with her posture and eye contact and not really the other
way around.
<p>"2. The follower is in control of the dance.&nbsp; Without someone who
has agreed to follow you, there can be no lead.&nbsp; There is nothing
'prey'-like about this and it is a completely conscious and active choice
on the part of the follower.&nbsp; Without her trust and response your
lead means nothing.&nbsp; Also, the way in which she interprets the lead
is her choice, so as a leader you have to be aware of and open to the possibilities
she presents.
<p>"3. The follower has an extremely influential role in the expression
of musicality.&nbsp; Her timing, responsiveness, and the manner in which
she executes the movements which are lead are all completely her responsibility.&nbsp;
Also, the spaces in between what you lead are hers to play with.
<p>"The best dances happen when both the leader and follower are striving
to make the dance delicious for the other person while confidently expressing
their personal uniqueness in a warm and trusting embrace.

<br>"There is only one embrace.&nbsp; It becomes closer or more open depending
on the crowd, the music, the partner, the movement, etc.&nbsp; The embrace
accommodates the dance and the dancers.
<p>"The separation of styles in terms of 'close' and 'open' embrace came
from the foreigners that began trying to make sense of tango in the early
1980s.&nbsp; People noticed a clear difference between the social embrace
and the stage embrace when the show Tango Argentino roared through the
world in the 1980s. ...
<p>"In a real sense, what is called 'open' social embrace now, began outside
of Argentina and is a result of a misunderstanding that stage tango is
not social tango.&nbsp; That distance between partners is much needed on
stage, just like the dreaded back step.&nbsp; Without the space between
partners, the dancers are invisible to the audience.&nbsp; On stage, everything
has to be made bigger.&nbsp; Without the back step, dancers would eventually
fall off the stage.&nbsp; So both of these elements, dreaded by many social
dancers, are much needed on stage.&nbsp; But on a social dance floor,&nbsp;
they are silly - they do not serve the purpose of an intimate exchange
that social tango calls for.&nbsp; What goes on between partners in a dance
is a secret.&nbsp; It is private and is contained by the embrace.&nbsp;
What goes on on stage is entertainment and is meant for public to see.
<p>"So, open=stage, close=social.&nbsp; Artistic license is allowed on
stage only.
<p>"There is another extreme called 'milonguero' style.&nbsp; The word
was coined by Susana Miller in the early 90's to describe the classes that
she was offering, which were meant to give people a quick ability to attend
milongas.&nbsp; Since milongas are very crowded, many were satisfied learning
just a few movements and not much technique and still be able to do something
on a crowded dance floor.&nbsp; I know this from a person who was there
when the term was first used.&nbsp; Milongueros never used that term.&nbsp;
Each one had developed his own style and was very proud of it.&nbsp; And
each one was very different from the others."
<p>I might add that sometimes beginners dance in an open embrace out of
a lack of skill or knowledge.

understanding rather than a rational one.&nbsp; The idea is that studying
the structure of tango is a quicker means of learning the knowledge that
the dancers of an older generation took 5+ years to master intuitively.
<p>I'm not proposing studying structure in a book as formal knowledge as
an end in itself.&nbsp; One has to develop the intuitive or subconcious
feel for the movements, and the only way to do so is by dancing.&nbsp;
The idea is to use the conscious mind to help train the intuitive mind
for dancing.

<p><a NAME="0011"></a><b><font size=+1>The Structure of Tango</font></b>
<br>20 July 2007 — Stephen Brown
<p>In numerous places throughout this website, I have written about the
importance of understanding the the structure of tango without ever really
defining what I mean by such a concept.
<p>If we think of tango as being made up of individual steps and sequences
of steps (step patterns), the structure of tango is the fabric from which
these movements are created.&nbsp; Structure is not these steps or step
patterns.&nbsp; Rather, it is discerned through an examination of step
possibilities.
<p>A number of tango dancers/instructors have examined tango's steps and
step patterns and have created theories that can be used to describe the
structure.&nbsp; Two such approaches to the examination of tango's structure
have been in use for a number of years.
<p>One approach emerged from a group of dancers led by Petroleo (Carlos
Estevez) and Salvador Sciana during the golden age of tango.&nbsp; The
group explored and developed turns.&nbsp; Mingo Pugliese was one of the
youngest members of the group, and he is credited for distilling the group's
thinking into a systematic approach to teaching turns (giros)&nbsp; The
system generalizes turns into eight-count right and left turns.&nbsp; The
system creates a frame of reference for the creation of all turning steps
including giros, molinetes, enrosques and ganchos.
<p>Another approach emerged from a group of dancers that was led by Gustavo
Naveira and included such dancers/teachers as Fabian Salas, Chicho Frumboli,
and (possibly) Pablo Veron.&nbsp; With contributions from his then partner,
Olga Besio, and some of his compatriots, Naveira developed a systematic
way for looking at nearly all the possible steps in tango.&nbsp; Some of
the concepts include parallel and crossed systems of walking, the weight
shifts necessary to switch between the parallel and cross systems, the
equivalence between cross walking and back ochos, and a generalized approach
to turns with a pivot and a circumference that incorporates giros, sacadas,
ochos, boleos, and other elements.&nbsp; Naveira's system can serve as
a frame of reference for creating nearly all tango steps.&nbsp; In addition,
the system helped bring into visibility some step patterns, such as overturn
ochos and changes of direction in turns, that were not previously used
with much frequency.
<p>Developing an understanding and mastery of the underlying structure
of tango through a system can greatly increase a tango dancer's improvisational
skills.

<p><a NAME="0010"></a><b><font size=+1>Approaches to Learning and Authenticity</font></b>
<br>19 July 2007 — Stephen Brown
<p>I find it helpful to think of&nbsp; tango as having four layers of learning
(from the top to the foundation).
<p>4) Step Patterns and Choreographies
<br>3) Structure of Tango
<br>2) Quality of Movement
<br>1) Rhythm and the Music - the foundation
<p>For each layer there are levels of mastery—beginning, intermediate,
advanced, etc.&nbsp; Rather than identifying their classes by layer, instructors
typically classify their instruction by the levels of mastery within the
layer they teach, which for most instructors is step patterns.
<p>Without sufficient mastery of the skills in the underlying layers, learning
at higher layers is relatively meaningless.&nbsp; In particular, learning
many step patterns or mini choreographies without a knowledge of the underlying
layers is like building a castle in the sky.&nbsp; Students without knowledge
of the underlying layers who study with the all-too abundant StepMeisters
are simply buying more bricks for their imaginary castles.&nbsp; The all
too many of the people who take workshops year after year without ever
really learning to dance tango probably fall into this category.
<p>The style of tango is really independent of these layers; but many milonguero-style
teachers emphasize rhythm and small elements of the dance.&nbsp; Many salon-style
teachers emphasize step patterns and the quality of movement.&nbsp; Many
of the nuevo-style teachers emphasize mastery of a structural knowledge,
and nearly all the technique instructors emphasize the quality of movement.&nbsp;
A heavy reliance on instruction in any one element is likely to result
in only a partial knowledge of tango, and in students who are only capable
of dancing in an imitation of the same style as their instructors.&nbsp;
If the instructor is but an imitation of another, that makes the student
an imitation of an imitation.&nbsp; That may be why so many of the Argentines
who teach tango claim only dead masters as being their instructors.
<p>So I have understanding why some claim that nearly all tango instruction
is worthless, and that others claim that only Argentines can be masters
of tango.

<p>In an interview published in the May 2007 issue of&nbsp; <a href="http://www.tangonoticias.com/" target="new">Tango
Noticias</a>, Pedro "Tete" Rusconi offered the following comments about
tango dancing in the United States:
<br>"[T]he problem ... is that organizers get anybody they can to come
and teach.&nbsp; But because this is a business, it's work for these dancers,
they don't come to teach you tango, they come to teach you steps. ... And
if you really think about it, the music is tango; it's not the steps.&nbsp;
Whatever style of dance you dance the music always comes first.&nbsp; So
what happens, if a teacher comes here and they sell you steps instead of
teaching how to dance, what happens?&nbsp; You don’t dance.&nbsp; You learn
steps because that is what you think you need to learn."
<p>How extensively Tete's comments apply to the quality of tango dancing
in entire United States is unclear to me.&nbsp; The interview was conducted
after Tete visited Chicago to participate in the Chicago Mini Tango Festival,
and he has not yet toured in many areas of the United States.&nbsp; It
is clear what he thinks about teaching tango as steps.

<br>"Greetings from the Southern Hemisphere, heading toward the winter
solstice and the lowest tourist season in Buenos Aires.&nbsp; I'm writing
a note regarding the pros and cons of travelling to Buenos Aires during
the South American winter for those who may be considering a trip.
<p><b>Pros:</b>
<br>"Classes, practices and milongas are less crowded, allowing room for
comfortable dancing.&nbsp; What a pleasure!
<p>"Because classes are less crowded, you are likely to get more individual
attention.
<p>"Fewer foreigners in the milongas means a higher chance you will dance
with Argentines.
<p>"The <a href="terminology.html#cabeceo">cabeceo</a> (asking to dance
with eye contact and a head gesture) works with more ease because you have&nbsp;
room to see people at their tables.
<p>"You don't have to worry about getting drenched with sweat (yours or
someone else's!) while dancing.
<p>"With fewer foreigners around, you will have more opportunities to speak
Spanish.
<p><b>Cons:</b>
<br>"If you don’t like cold weather, it’s not the time to come.&nbsp; It
rarely gets below freezing here, but the cold is a humid one, and you feel
it.
<p>"If you prefer being part of a denser international scene in the milongas,
March or April is best.
<p>"Some people’s favorite teachers/performers are abroad, teaching in
summer festivals in the United States and Europe.
<p><b>Advice:</b>
<br>"Bring clothes for layering.&nbsp; On the street you will feel cold.
Your first 30 minutes at the milonga you may feel cold.&nbsp; Once you
start dancing you will warm up quickly.&nbsp; I suggest that women bring
something to keep over their shoulders while sitting at the milongas.&nbsp;
However, never keep your coat on inside the milonga, because it will project
an air of unavailability.
<p>"Insides of apartments can get quite cold because insulation and heating
systems are different.&nbsp; So bring warm clothes for inside the house."

green to me, autumn is around the corner here in Buenos Aires.&nbsp; The
city is starting to wake up piece by piece.&nbsp; People are filtering
back from the beach, kids are gearing up for a new school year, and everyone
hopes that the most recent heat wave will be the last one.
<p>"For tango dancers in Buenos Aires, the changing of the seasons is always
something very special.&nbsp; The summer/autumn turnover in particular
features two very important tango festivals, both filled with talent and
mastery. In a couple of weeks (February 23 to March 4), we will have the
Festival Buenos Aires Tango put on by the city government.&nbsp; This is
a great, non-touristy festival that makes tango very accessible to the
locals.&nbsp; All over the city you can find classes and performances open
to the public, culminating in the not to be missed outdoor milonga that
takes place on a major avenue downtown (streets are closed off).&nbsp;
[For more information, see the <a href="http://www.festivaldetango.gov.ar/" target="new">Buenos
Aires Tango Festival</a> website.]
<p>"Then from March 11-18 we have the Congreso Internacional de Tango Argentino
(CITA) put on by Fabian Salas and Cosmotango.&nbsp; This Festival brings
together many great and well known tango dancers and performers.&nbsp;
The show(s) that CITA puts on are a must-see; they are all dancing and
loaded with some of today's best performers.&nbsp; [For more information,
see the <a href="http://www.cosmotango.com/" target="new">Cosmo Tango</a>

<p>"Besides the festivals, it's a wonderful time of year to be dancing
tango in Buenos Aires.&nbsp; Dressing lightly is more comfortable.&nbsp;
As a woman, I love to leave the panty hose behind and dance with bare legs
and sandals at the milongas. Also, there are a few great venues to dance
tango outside.&nbsp; If you are here while it's warm, I suggest you go
on a Saturday night to the milonga&nbsp; 'La Calesita' at the Club IMOS,
Comodoro Rivadavia 1350.&nbsp; Another great place to go in the early evening
on Sundays is La Glorieta, 11 de Septiembre y Echeverria."
