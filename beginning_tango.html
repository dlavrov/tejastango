<h3>
<a NAME="welcome"></a>Welcome to Argentine Tango</h3>
Argentine tango has been thrilling dancers for more than 100 years. Tango
is loved by dancers and audiences for its beauty, passion, drama and excitement.
Learning to dance tango socially is based on improvisational movement and
respecting both your partner and the other dancers on the floor. The essence
of Argentine tango is about life and, especially, about the relationship
between a man and a woman. Graciela Gonzales, a leading tango instructor,
calls the dance "the history of love—for three minutes."&nbsp; In this
guide, I offer a brief overview of tango history, what to expect in classes,
the various types of tango danced at social events, the music, and tango
etiquette. I've also included useful terms, a Beginner's checklist and
some resources available through the Internet.

<a href="#top" class="bando yellowb"></a>

<h3>
<a NAME="yesterday"></a>Tango Yesterday and Today</h3>
The exact origins of tango—both the dance and the word itself—are lost
in myth and an unrecorded history. The generally accepted theory is that
in the mid-1800s, African slaves were brought to Argentina and began to
influence the local culture. The word "tango" may be straightforwardly
African in origin, meaning "closed place" or "reserved ground." Or it may
derive from Portuguese (and from the Latin verb tanguere, to touch) and
was picked up by Africans on the slave ships. Whatever its origin, the
word "tango" acquired the standard meaning of the place where African slaves
and free blacks gathered to dance.
<p>Argentina was undergoing a massive immigration during the later part
of the 1800s and early 1900s. In 1869, Buenos Aires had a population of
180,000. By 1914, its population was 1.5 million. The intermixing of African,
Spanish, Italian, British, Polish, Russian and native-born Argentines resulted
in a melting pot of cultures, and each borrowed dance and music from one
another. Traditional polkas, waltzes and mazurkas were mixed with the popular
habanera from Cuba and the candombe rhythms from Africa.
<p>Most immigrants were single men hoping to earn their fortunes in this
newly expanding country. They were typically poor and desperate, hoping
to make enough money to return to Europe or bring their families to Argentina.
The evolution of tango reflects their profound sense of loss and longing
for the people and places they left behind.
<p>Most likely the tango was born in African-Argentine dance venues attended
by compadritos, young men, mostly native born and poor, who liked to dress
in slouch hats, loosely tied neckerchiefs and high-heeled boots with knives
tucked casually into their belts. The compadritos took the tango back to
the Corrales Viejos—the slaughterhouse district of Buenos Aires—and introduced
it in various low-life establishments where dancing took place: bars, dance
halls and brothels. It was here that the African rhythms met the Argentine
milonga music (a fast-paced polka) and soon new steps were invented and
took hold.
<p>Although high society looked down upon the activities in the barrios,
well-heeled sons of the porte&ntilde;o oligarchy were not averse to slumming.
Eventually, everyone found out about the tango and, by the beginning of
the twentieth century, the tango as both a dance and as an embryonic form
of popular music had established a firm foothold in the fast-expanding
city of its birth. It soon spread to provincial towns of Argentina and
across the River Plate to Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, where it
became as much a part of the urban culture as in Buenos Aires.
<p>The worldwide spread of the tango came in the early 1900s when wealthy
sons of Argentine society families made their way to Paris and introduced
the tango into a society eager for innovation and not entirely averse to
the risqu&eacute; nature of the dance or dancing with young, wealthy Latin
men. By 1913, the tango had become an international phenomenon in Paris,
London and New York. There were tango teas, tango train excursions and
even tango colors—most notably orange. The Argentine elite who had shunned
the tango were now forced into accepting it with national pride.
<p>The tango spread worldwide throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The dance
appeared in movies and tango singers traveled the world. By the 1930s,
the Golden Age of Argentina was beginning. The country became one of the
ten richest nations in the world and music, poetry and culture flourished.
The tango came to be a fundamental expression of Argentine culture, and
the Golden Age lasted through the 1940s and 1950s.
<p>Tango's fortunes have always been tied to economic conditions and this
was very true in the 1950s. During this time, as political repression developed,
lyrics reflected political feelings until they started to be banned as
subversive. The dance and its music went underground as large dance venues
were closed and large gatherings in general were prohibited. The tango
survived in smaller, unpublicized venues and in the hearts of the people.
<p>The necessity of going underground combined with the eventual invasion
of rock and roll sent the tango into decline until the mid-1980s when the
stage show <i>Tango Argentino</i> opened in Paris. Once again Paris was
ground zero for igniting tango excitement worldwide. The show toured the
world and stimulated a revival in Europe, North America and Japan that
we are part of today.

<h3>
<a NAME="basics"></a>Argentine Tango Basics</h3>
Argentine tango is an improvisational dance based on the four building
blocks of walking, turning, stopping and embellishments. The dance is like
a puzzle that gets put together differently each time. Women and men bring
their own styles and embellishments to the dance which contribute significantly
to the excitement and unpredictability of the experience. Even though dancers
follow certain conventions, they never quite know how someone will construct
a dance, add an embellishment or interpret the music. The surprises possible
within the dance are what make the dance so addicting. It really does take
two to tango, because the dance isn't just about the man leading and the
woman following. Both partners have important things to contribute—like
all good conversations.
<p>Tango is danced counterclockwise around a floor just like a horse race.
Dancers try to stay on the outside edges of the floor and away from the
center space. If you were able to look down on a tango dance floor, you'd
see dancers move as if floating down a river—flowing smoothly forward sometimes
and occasionally stopping for a spin in a shallow eddy.

<a href="#top" class="bando yellowb"></a>

<h3>
<a NAME="ballroom"></a>Is Argentine Tango the Same as Ballroom Tango?</h3>
No. They started out from the same roots, but location, time and the ever
evolving nature of dance have made them separate dances. The American and
International ballroom tangos you may see on PBS, are very different from
the tango danced socially in Argentina. Argentine tango is different from
the ballroom tangos in its posture, embrace, improvisation, movement, balance,
steps, and music. It's completely different from the top of your head to
the bottom of the soles of the shoes you dance it with.
<p>If you have a background in ballroom tango, just think of Argentine
tango as a completely new dance—not as an enhancement of the one you already
know.

<a href="#top" class="bando yellowb"></a>

<h3>
<a NAME="stage"></a>Is Argentine Tango the Stage Dance?</h3>
Quite a few people develop an interest in dancing tango because they have
seen a stage performance of tango. The tango you see on stage is related
to social tango, but it is also very different. Stage tango is called "fantasia"
and is more theatrical and exaggerated than social tango for the simple
reason that the audience must be able to see it performed from the back
row.
<p>Watching a performance is a wonderful opportunity to see tango and (hopefully)
hear a live tango orchestra. Once you've heard a bandoneon played live,
you'll never forget it.

<a href="#top" class="bando yellowb"></a>


<h3>
<a NAME="classes"></a>Attending Tango Classes</h3>
When you're a beginning tango student, attending a class is the best way
to get your bearings in the dance. Sign up and attend regularly.&nbsp;
Every good dancer I know is good because they signed up for the first series
of classes and attended all of them. Learning to dance tango is a wonderful
commitment you make for yourself and consistency is as important to achieving
this goal as it is for all others in your life. Signing up and coming to
one class a month here and there will just be frustrating for you.
<p>A good tango class should introduce you to the following elements of
tango: walking, turning, stopping, navigation, musicality and some embellishments.
Tango is a dance based on walking so you must practice this essential element.
The good news is that you already know how to walk, you just need to practice
taking a partner with you. All great tango dancers work on their walk.&nbsp;
In fact, one of the best compliments a tango dancer can receive is, "Look
how well he walks!"&nbsp; No matter how experienced the students, I've
never seen a good tango teacher start a class without walking exercises.
<p>After you've "walked your miles" you'll learn how to turn, how to stop
momentarily on the floor, how to navigate a crowded floor, how to listen
to and learn the various types of tango music and how to add your own signature
to the dance in the form of embellishments. Because tango is an improvisational
dance, you should also be exposed to that aspect of the dance as well.
Tango is a dance you create on the fly with another person. It isn't about
memorized steps that go together the same way every time. This is one of
the most beautiful aspects of tango and is the one that makes the dance
endlessly interesting.

<a href="#top" class="bando yellowb"></a>


<h3>
<a NAME="partner"></a>Do I Need a Partner?</h3>
You do not need a partner to start learning to dance tango. There are always
a variety of people taking classes and it's unusual for everyone to come
with a partner. In my experience, more people come without a partner than
with. If a class has a gender imbalance, a teacher can ask people to rotate
so everyone has a chance to learn. Don't let the lack of a partner stand
in the way of learning.


<a href="#top" class="bando yellowb"></a>


<h3>
<a NAME="teachers"></a>Tango Teachers</h3>
If you're lucky to live in a city with at least one tango instructor, try
them out. They can be your first guides to the world of tango.&nbsp; In
addition to teaching classes, local teachers usually help arrange (or know
of) workshops with visiting instructors and opportunities to dance tango
socially. If your city has more than one instructor, take several classes
from all of them. Attend their practices and dances. See whose teaching
and dancing style you like and whose method of instruction feels right
for you. In my experience, the best tango teachers are the ones who bring
out the best in you rather than try to get you to conform to a particular
style (which interestingly enough is usually theirs). If you feel welcome
in a class, chances are it's the right one for you.


<a href="#top" class="bando yellowb"></a>

<h3>
<a NAME="video"></a>Learning from Video</h3>
If you don't have any local instruction available, there are many videos
available to study. If this is your case, you will need a partner to study
with. Even if you are studying by video, I recommend occasionally traveling
to take classes (group or private) and attend dances to have the experience
of dancing with others. You can learn much from tapes, but real hands-on
experience is irreplaceable.
<p>An extensive guide to instructional video is available at <a href="video_resources.html">Video
Resources for the Tango Dancer</a>.

<a href="#top" class="bando yellowb"></a>

<h3>
<a NAME="workshops"></a>Attending Workshops</h3>
As you become comfortable with the important elements of tango, you may
want to attend (in your own city or elsewhere) special weekend workshops
that provide the opportunity to meet and learn from some of the world's
best professional dancers. In addition, several week-long workshops are
held in Argentina and around the world which also offer an incredible chance
to combine travel with learning tango.
<p>Visiting instructors come to town for many reasons. Find out in advance
from both the local organizer and dancers if the type of instruction, the
style being taught and the level of dance experience expected in the class
is right for you. If the visiting instructors are offering classes for
beginners, check them out. You never know who will provide just the right
information to make something clear.
<p>Early in your study of tango, you'll probably take workshops from as
many different instructors as possible. Over time, however, you'll find
certain instructors have a teaching and/or dancing style that fits your
inclinations and you'll probably narrow down the number of people you study
with. You have an amazing variety of teachers and places to dance available
to you—worldwide.


<a href="#top" class="bando yellowb"></a>


<h3>
<a NAME="private"></a>Taking Private Lessons</h3>
Private lessons from either local or visiting teachers are a great way
to have someone evaluate and make recommendations about your own dancing.
When an instructor can look at your dancing without having to look at 40
other people at the same time, you can really learn a tremendous amount.
One hour of private instruction with a great dancer can save you many hours
of frustration and help you avoid painful mistakes—both emotionally and
physically.
<p>My recommendation regarding spending your money on private lessons is
as follows (1) start learning in group classes to see if you like tango,
(2) attend group classes for at least two months to begin to master the
basics, and, (3) attend milongas (tango parties) and dance and watch. Once
you've done these things, then look around and see if there is a local
instructor you'd like to schedule a private lesson with. Or perhaps a visiting
instructor is coming you'd like to study with. Most visiting instructors
teach private lessons in addition to any workshops they teach. Keep in
mind that different instructors may have different requirements for private
lessons (such as requiring you to bring a partner) and may be in very limited
supply.
<p>If you don't have local instruction available, traveling for private
lessons is going to be one of the only ways to get personal feedback. Here
my recommendations are a little different. Search around on the Internet
for either local teachers nearby or teachers who may be holding a workshop
in a city you're interesting in visiting. Talk to everyone you can about
their recommendations regarding whether the teachers are appropriate for
beginners, their style, etc. Tango dancers love to talk about tango, so
don't hesitate to call or email someone. Then set up a few private lessons
spread out over a couple of days. Don't try to pack too much in one day—your
brain needs times to understand and your muscles need time to assimilate
new movements.
<p>One word of caution about private lessons. Be wary of instructors who
approach you about taking lessons from them. Some teachers love to approach
beginners and try to make them believe that there is a shortcut to learning
tango through private lessons with them. It's been my experience that instructors
who tell you how much better you could be if only you had a few private
lessons from them are usually just out for your money. There are no shortcuts.
Save your money for instructors who are there to enrich your experience
of tango and not their pockets.

<a href="#top" class="bando yellowb"></a>

<h3>
<a NAME="practice"></a>Practice, Practice, Practice</h3>
One of the most important aspects of learning tango is practicing on your
own. If there are weekly practices in your city, pick one or two or three
and go. If not, rent space at a studio (this usually costs about $10-15
for a hour of practice time) or dance in your living room. I've found that
regular practice is the most important element in becoming a proficient
tango dancer. It's also a good way to meet other people in the tango community
who have more experience with the dance. They can be a great resource to
answer questions.


<a href="#top" class="bando yellowb"></a>


<h3>
<a NAME="shoes"></a>Tango Shoes</h3>
The search for great tango shoes is part of the fun of dancing. Tango is
typically danced in shoes with leather bottoms that stay on your feet well.
Shoes with straps for women and lace-up shoes for men are the most common.
Women also need to wear shoes with a heel. In the beginning, open-toed
shoes for women and slip-on shoes for men are usually disasters. There
are shoes designed specifically for tango dancers, but your main consideration
should be to find shoes that support your feet, don't squish your toes,
and are comfortable enough to dance in for several hours.&nbsp; I don't
recommend using ballroom dance shoes because they have little to no support
and suede soles.
<p>No matter what shoes you dance in, everyone should add pads to their
shoes. I recommend Spenco pads because they are incredibly comfortable,
resilient and long lasting.&nbsp; Dr Scholl's foam pads are OK, but avoid
the expensive and useless blue gel-filled pads.&nbsp; They seem like a
good idea–a waterbed for your feet–but are extremely disappointing.

Shoes</a>.

Shoe Pads</a>.

<a href="#top" class="bando yellowb"></a>

<h3>
<a NAME="family"></a>The Family of Tango Dances</h3>
There are actually three tango dances—each with its own music—in Argentine
social dance. During the course of an evening of dancing all three will
be played and danced. The first is simply tango. This is the dance most
people would recognize as tango and the dance most beginners learn first.
Its music is typically based on a slow, steady four-count beat. The second
dance is called milonga. Milonga is a faster-paced dance based on simplified
tango steps. It has much the same rhythm and feeling as a polka. Milonga
music is historically older than tango music, but the dance itself is actually
newer. Milonga is a dance simply for fun. The third is tango waltz, called
vals or vals cruzado. Tango waltz music is based on the classic 1-2-3 of
waltz, but in this type of tango, dancers typically dance on the ones.
<p>The word "milonga" has three uses in tango. It means, (1) the dance
milonga, (2) the music you dance the milonga to, and (3) a tango dance
party. It's possible for you to dance a milonga to a milonga at a milonga.
And believe me, that's a great thing.


<a href="#top" class="bando yellowb"></a>

<h3>
<a NAME="styles"></a>Styles of Argentine Tango</h3>
Within Argentine tango there are various styles you may hear people refer
to.&nbsp; They will say, "Oh, he's milonguero dancer," or "She dances salon
style."&nbsp; Styles are as unique as dancers and I think it's rather foolish
to try to categorize either. Just remember if you hear terms like "salon,"
"milonguero," "fantasia," or "orillero" someone is talking about a certain
style.
<p>As with any evolving art form, trying to pin down the rules is impossible.
Every day, new styles come forward and dancers find ways to play with them
and incorporate them into their dance. In the past few years, styles known
as neuvo and liquid have appeared. Who knows what's coming next? All we
know is that it's coming.
<p>For descriptions of the various styles see <a href="tango_styles.html">Styles
of Argentine Tango</a>.


<a href="#top" class="bando yellowb"></a>


<h3>
<a NAME="music"></a>Tango Music</h3>
The history of tango music is as rich and interesting as the dance. Tango
music in Argentina followed much the same evolution as swing music did
in the United States. It started as simple rhythms played for dancers by
orchestras led by some colorful and charismatic bandleaders. Over time,
simpler rhythms evolved to more complicated ones and finally edged toward
more jazz-like interpretations less suitable for dancing but wonderful
for listening.
<p>Tango music is probably most distinguished from other types of music
by two things: the bandoneon and the lack of drums. The bandoneon is a
German instrument that looks and sounds like the offspring of an accordion
and an organ. In fact, the instrument was invented to provide organ-like
music to church congregations unable to afford a real organ. Like a lot
of immigrants to Argentina, the bandoneon found its way into the culture
and left an indelible mark on it.
<p>You may also notice that there are no drums in tango music. The beat
is kept on a bass and the lower register of the piano with (usually) bandoneons,
violins and the upper register of the piano providing the fascinating rhythms.
<p>When you start dancing tango, you'll most likely be dancing to the most
rhythmic music from the 1940s and 1950s known as the Golden Age of tango.
Music from the late 1930s is also great for learning how to hear the beat
and feel the rhythm. As you become more experienced, later music (including
that of modern tango orchestras) with its more modern jazzy rhythms becomes
very interesting to interpret.
<p>To develop your understanding of the music, you may want to consult
the guide <a href="tango_music_beginning.html">Music for Dancers New to
Argentine Tango</a>. It lists the CDs best-suited for dancers first learning
to hear the rhythm of Argentine tango music.


<a href="#top" class="bando yellowb"></a>


<h3>
<a NAME="party"></a>At the Milonga (Tango Dance Party)</h3>
The pure joy of dancing tango is found at the milonga. A milonga refers
to the event where tangos, milongas and waltzes are danced.
<p><b>What is a Tanda?</b>
<br>At a milonga, music is played in sets called "tandas." Usually three
or four songs are played by the same orchestra followed by the "cortina"
(the curtain) which signals the end of the tanda. If you ask someone to
dance and they accept, it is assumed that it will be for the entire tanda.
<p>Cortinas are an interesting little detail at a milonga. A cortina is
unique to each DJ. Some will select one cortina for an evening and some
will use a different one for each tanda. Some are humorous; some are grating
on the ears; some are simply beautiful music. In any case, the cortina
is supposed to be a piece of music that people know not to dance to. It's
your signal to smile, say thank you and (possibly) change partners
<p><b>How Someone Asks for a Dance</b>
<br>In Argentina, men ask women to dance with a look—a certain glance,
movement of the head toward the dance floor or smile that says, "Dance
with me?"&nbsp; This can take place from far across the room if the right
eyes are caught. If a woman wants to accept a dance with a man, she smiles
back and (most important) keeps looking at him while he approaches her.
The slightest glance away is usually interpreted as meaning "I've changed
my mind and don't want to dance." This system is very wonderful and full
of pitfalls. What if the asker is looking at the woman behind you?&nbsp;
Did you really see a "yes" or a "maybe?"
<p>Because we are caught up in this Argentine art form, the practice of
asking people to dance with the eyes is also followed to some extent. In
many areas of the world, however, you may ask someone to dance directly
or with your best Argentine eyes. As in the dance, practice makes perfect.
<p><b>Accepting a Dance or Saying "No, thank you"</b>
<br>Accepting a dance is as simple as saying "yes." You can do this with
your eyes—be on the look out for people who ask the Argentine way—or by
accepting a direct invitation.
<p>It is also perfectly acceptable to say, "No, thank you." If you accept
a dance remember it will probably last for the remainder of the tanda that
is playing—three or four songs if you start at the beginning. If either
one of you decides that one or two dances is enough, however, either person
can simply say "thank you" and begin leaving the dance floor. Once you
say "thank you" to someone in a polite manner, the dance with that person
is over.
<p><b>Dancing at a Milonga as a Beginner</b>
<br>As a beginner, you'll either be eager to dance with everyone or hesitant
to be seen as a beginner. If you're eager to dance, go for it. Just remember
that tango is danced in lanes that keep moving and the more experienced
dancers tend to stay toward the outside. If you're hesitant, I can guarantee
you that everyone in the room has been a beginner at one time and understands
how nerve wracking it can be to look around and see everyone gliding by
when you only know three movements. Even someone who has been dancing for
only two weeks longer than you have will look like they've been at it for
years longer. I can't explain it; it always looks like that.
<p>The way to become a good dancer is to show up and dance. As Woody Allen
once said, "98 percent of success is showing up."

<a NAME="checklist"></a>A Beginner's Checklist</h3>
Here is a list of things you should be able to accomplish as a beginner.
<p><b>For Leaders:</b>
<br>1. Know how to ask someone to dance
<br>2. Follow the line of dance and stay in your lane
<br>3. Walk smoothly
<br>4. Keep your own balance
<br>5. Keep the rhythm (even at the expense of executing fancier steps)
<br>6. Be aware of where you and others are on the floor
<br>7. Know how to walk, turn, stop and lead a few embellishments
<br>8. Know how to interrupt a step to keep from hitting another couple
<br>9. Know how to put basic elements together to make a dance
<p><b>For Followers:</b>
<br>1. Know how to accept or decline a dance
<br>2. Wait for the lead
<br>3. Walk smoothly and walk to the cross well
<br>4. Keep your own balance
<br>5. Keep the rhythm
<br>6. Be aware of others on the floor
<br>7. Know how to walk, turn, stop and execute a few embellishments
<p>Once you have mastered the elements on these lists, you are an intermediate
dancer. As an intermediate dancer you will work on how to dance more improvisationally,
how to improve your posture and balance, how to interpret the music on
a more sophisticated level, and how to combine many basic elements to form
new dance steps or perhaps create your own.
