<p>Recent visitors and economic analysts report that economic conditions in
Argentina are improving and that visitors will see little evidence of the
recent economic upheavel in the country other than a very favorable exchange
rate.</p>

    <p>Almost across the board, Argentina’s economy is booming.
The recovery gathered steam throughout last year and since September, GDP has
expanded at an annual rate of 11%.  What makes this growth remarkable
is that only two years ago Argentina was in chaos.
In 2001 it suffered its worst economic collapse in more than a century.
After a slow
start, recovery of the Argentine economy has been swifter than many expected,
and similar to that in other countries that have unpegged their currencies.</p>

  <dt>– by Stephen Brown</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>In the wake of the recent meltdown of the Argentine economy, many analysts
have promoted the view that the Argentine national character is somehow
responsible for the economic and political problems in Argentina. 
Having met many Argentines through tango, however, I must express skepticism
about the premise that the recurring economic and political problems in
Argentina are the consequence of a flawed national character.</p>

  <dt>– by Brooke Burdett</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>In August 2002, a five-year resident of Buenos Aires examined how Argentina’s
economic crisis affected the desirability of visiting Buenos Aires as a
tango tourist.  Although the economic upheavel raised some concerns
about safety, she considered the trip worthwhile at the time.  Because
Argentina’s economic conditions have improved over the past year without
much appreciation of the Argentine peso, visiting has become safer and
remained inexpensive.</p>
