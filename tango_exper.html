Tango developed in an environment similar to American jazz.&nbsp; A collision
of cultures and musical and dance idioms created a new music and dance
form.&nbsp; At the time of tango's origin and during its golden age, Argentina
was full of people, primarily men, who had emigrated from the homelands
of their youth, primarily Europe, to the rough and tumble environment of
Argentina.&nbsp; Their sense of alienation, and longings for homeland,
sweethearts, and meaningful lives can be found in the poetic lyrics to
numerous tangos such as "Naranjo en Flor" and "Charlemos," that are rich
in multiple interpretation.

Naranjo en Flor - Orange Tree in Bloom (1944)</h3>
Music by Virgilio Exposito
<br>Lyrics by Homero Exposito (1918-1987)

<td>Era mas blanda que el agua,&nbsp;
<br>que el agua blanda,&nbsp;
<br>era mas fresca que el rio,&nbsp;
<br>naranjo en flor...&nbsp;
<p>Y en esa calle de estio,&nbsp;
<br>calle perdida,&nbsp;
<br>dejo un pedazo de vida&nbsp;
<br>y se marcho...&nbsp;
<p>Primero hay que saber sufrir,&nbsp;
<br>despues amar, despues partir&nbsp;
<br>y al fin andar sin pensamiento...&nbsp;
<br>Perfume de naranjo en flor,&nbsp;
<br>promesas vanas de un amor&nbsp;
<br>que se escaparon en el viento...&nbsp;
<p>Despues, que importa el despues?&nbsp;
<br>Toda mi vida es el ayer&nbsp;
<br>que me detiene en el pasado,&nbsp;
<br>eterna y vieja juventud&nbsp;
<br>que me ha dejado acobardado&nbsp;
<br>como un pajaro sin luz.&nbsp;
<p>Que le habran hecho mis manos?&nbsp;
<br>Que le habran hecho&nbsp;
<br>para dejarme en el pecho&nbsp;
<br>tanto dolor?&nbsp;
<p>Dolor de vieja arboleda,&nbsp;
<br>cancion de esquina&nbsp;
<br>con un pedazo de vida,&nbsp;
<br>naranjo en flor...&nbsp;</td>

<td>She was softer than water,&nbsp;
<br>than soft water,&nbsp;
<br>she was fresher than the river,&nbsp;
<br>flowering orange tree...&nbsp;
<p>In that summer street,&nbsp;
<br>lost street,&nbsp;
<br>she left a piece of life&nbsp;
<br>and left...&nbsp;
<p>First one has to know suffering,&nbsp;
<br>then how to love, then how to depart,&nbsp;
<br>at the end walk thoughtless roads...&nbsp;
<br>Perfume of flowering orange tree,&nbsp;
<br>useless promises of love&nbsp;
<br>that escaped in the wind...&nbsp;
<p>Afterwards, does it count?&nbsp;
<br>All my life is a yesterday&nbsp;
<br>that detains me in my past,&nbsp;
<br>eternal, ancient youth&nbsp;
<br>that has left me intimidated&nbsp;
<br>like a bird without light.&nbsp;
<p>What did my hands do to her?&nbsp;
<br>What must they have done&nbsp;
<br>to leave in my chest&nbsp;
<br>so much pain?&nbsp;
<p>Pain of an old grove,&nbsp;
<br>song in a street corner&nbsp;
<br>with a piece of life,&nbsp;
<br>flowering orange tree...</td>

<p>The beauty of these lyrics show the great Homero Exposito's creativity
and poetry, but they also tell of lost love, a love that existed in another
time and place—a love that strikes with intensity, in a transient way,
like the perfume of flowering orange trees in spring, or like the sense
of connection during a tango.&nbsp; From the lyrics, one gets a sense of
separation, suffering, a longing for the past, possibly remorse or a questioning
of what might have gone wrong, as the tango comes to a close.&nbsp; The
lost love may be a woman, youth, spirit, a homeland symbolized by orange
groves that were left behind (possibly in Spain), or simply the intense
feeling of connection that existed for the three minutes of a tango dance.

<p>At one level, "Charlemos" might be interpreted as being about a lonely
man whose blindness isolates him from the rest of society.&nbsp; He attempts
to fulfill his need for love by talking to a stranger on the telephone;
knowing that he will never be able to see or meet her because he is unwilling
to impose his handicap on a healthy woman.
<p>The last lines need not be interpreted so literallly, however.&nbsp;
The speaker might be figuratively blinded by the sorrow of losing Renee's
love and seeking solace from another woman.&nbsp; His statement&nbsp; <i><font color="#FF0000">Renee
yo se que no existe...&nbsp;&nbsp; I know Renee does not exist...</font></i>&nbsp;
would be also interpreted figuratively as meaning that Renee no longer
exists for him.
<p>When the speakers says,
<br>&nbsp;

<table class="table table-bordered" COLS=2 WIDTH="40%" >

<td><i><font color="#FF0000">Hablemos de un amor...&nbsp;</font></i>

<p>he would be suggesting that he and the stranger pretend that they are
Renee and her new lover.&nbsp; Their pretense will soften the anguish and
sadness he feels from being a spurned lover on this gray afternoon. The
stranger's feminine voice brings him solace, but in the end he realizes
that will not change the fact that she is not Renee, and he is not Renee's
new lover.&nbsp; When she suggests meeting, he refuses because he prefers
illusion.
<p>Perhaps Renee represents the speaker's homeland, and the stranger on
the line represents Argentina.&nbsp; Perhaps because it could not support
him, the man left his homeland for Argentina.&nbsp; Now he feels rejected
and betrayed by his homeland—which he cannot find, to which he cannot return,
and whose existence he now doubts.&nbsp; In his anguish and blindness,
he has sought to fill the feelings for his homeland with Argentina, but
cannot do so.&nbsp; When he is confronted with the reality of his existence
(when the stranger suggests they meet), he prefers illusion.
<p>Dancing Argentine tango itself can create such feelings—particularly
when it is danced with the proper stranger.&nbsp; For the length of a well-danced
and magically sublime tango, we touch each others' hearts in ways words
cannot match. We get a sense of returning to a home where we belong, where
we loved and felt loved—even if that home exists only in the depths of
our souls rather than our personal history.&nbsp; Then the song ends, the
dance is over, and we return as strangers to our respective tables or sides
of the room. Worse, we can begin talking and find that all we have in common
is a history of well-danced tango together.&nbsp; Maybe it is better for
us to remain strangers with our illusions, as the speaker decides in "Charlemos."
<p>In <i>Paper Tangos</i>, Julie Taylor quotes a young milonguero as saying,
"In a tango, together with the girl—and it does not matter who she is—a
man remembers the bitter moments in his life, and he, she, and all who
are dancing contemplate a universal emotion.&nbsp; I do not like the woman
to talk to me when I dance tango.&nbsp; And if she speaks, I do not answer.&nbsp;
Only when she says to me 'Omar, I am speaking,' I answer, 'and I, I am
dancing.'"
